BDI Agent in prolog

Hi,

My problem is to write basic functions of BDI Agent in prolog. The
problem
description(case) is about Tileworld and only one agent is invloved.
Please
give me some ideas for the problem.

The Tileworld consists of a two-dimensional grid of locations,
extending to
infinity in both directions. Some locations contain "food" resources
(of
varying values), which agents must "eat" in order to score points. An
agent
eats a piece of food by moving to its location and executing an eat
action.
Agents can move one square at a time either horizontally or
vertically. The
world is dynamic in that food may spontaneously appear at a randomly
determined location at any time.

The agent's beliefs at any time simply consist of a list containing
one term
of the form at(X,Y) representing the current location of the agent.
The
agent's beliefs are always correct.

The agent's goals at any time are a list of locations of food items
and
their values. Each goal of the agent is represented as an term
goal(X,Y,S),
where (X,Y) is the location of the food and S is its value.

The agent's intentions are these goals ordered according to some
priority.
To fulfil an intention, the agent's action is just to move along some
path
towards the corresponding goal and collect the reward (the actual path
is
determined at run time).

There are three types of action the agent can execute in any one
cycle:
null - the agent does nothing
eat(X,Y) - the agent eats the food at (X,Y) and gains the associated
reward
move(X,Y) - the agent moves to the location (X,Y)

The agent's prioritization strategy is very simple: each new goal is
inserted into the list of intentions in order of the closeness of the
food
item to the agent's current position (closer items coming earlier in
the
list). However, once a goal is incorporated into the list of
intentions, it
is never re-prioritized with respect to existing goals as the agent
moves
about (hence after some time the list may not accurately reflect the
closeness of food to the agent).

The agent chooses to go towards the food item nearest to the agent
when it
appeared. The
initial state of the world is always that there is no food and the
agent is
at the location (0,0).

HERE ARE THE QUESTIONS. PLEASE GIVE ME SOME IDEAS OR ALGORITHMS. I AM
LOST!!

1. How to write a Prolog procedure incorporate intentions(Options,
Beliefs,
Intentions, Intentions1) which has four arguments: a list of options
each of
the form goal(X,Y,S), a list of beliefs (here containing one term of
the
form at(X,Y)), the current list of intentions each of the form
goal(X,Y,S),
and computes a list which contains the new options inserted into the
current
list of intentions in order of the Manhattan distance of the goal from
the
agent's current location. If an option is the same distance from the
agent
as an existing goal, the new goal should be placed later in the list.

2. How to write a Prolog procedure select action(Beliefs, Intentions,
Action) which takes the agent's beliefs (a singleton list containing
an term for the agent's location) and the list of intentions, and
computes an action to be taken by the agent. Note that the goal
selected by the agent is the first on the list of intentions, and in
the case of a move action, the action should specify the coordinates
to which the agent should move (being one square from the agent's
current location). Due to the use of Manhattan distance and the fact
that there are no obstacles in the world, the exact path the agent
takes towards the goal does not matter much, so choose the simplest
way of implementing this procedure.

3. How to write two Prolog procedures update beliefs(Observation,
Beliefs,
Beliefs1) and update intentions(Observation, Intentions, Intentions1)
to
compute the lists of beliefs and intentions resulting from the agent's
observations. (one line for each possible observation type)!

4. How to write a Prolog procedure trigger(Events, Options) which
takes a
list of events, each of the form food(X,Y,S) and computes a list of
options
for the agent, each of the form goal(X,Y,S).

_______________

The following Prolog program implements the experimental setup,
including the generation of events (appearance of food) and the
execution of actions, and the agent's BDI interpretation cycle and
observation functions. It consists of one agent in the Tileworld that
repeatedly executes the BDI interpretation cycle for 20 iterations.
The produced code must work with this program.

% Simulates a single agent in the Tileworld where food appears on each
cycle
% at randomly % determined locations in the 10x10 grid with
probability 0.3

% run a trial of 20 cycles of the BDI interpreter starting with the
agent at (0,0)

agent_trial :-
        init,
        agent_trials(0, 20, [at(0,0)], [], 0, Score),
        write('Total score: '), print(Score), !.


% initial state of the world

init :-
        assert(robot_at(0,0)).


% run trials up to N

agent_trials(N, N, _, _, Score, Score) :- !.

agent_trials(N1, N, Beliefs, Intentions, Score, Score2) :-
        N1 < N,
        agent_cycle(N1, Beliefs, Beliefs1, Intentions, Intentions1, S),
        Score1 is Score + S,
        N2 is N1 + 1,
        agent_trials(N2, N, Beliefs1, Intentions1, Score1, Score2).


% the BDI interpretation cycle used by the agent

agent_cycle(N, Beliefs, Beliefs1, Intentions, Intentions2, S) :-
        write('Cycle '), write(N), print(':'),
        new_events(N, Events),
        trigger(Events, Options),
        incorporate_intentions(Options, Beliefs, Intentions, Intentions1),
        write('    Intentions: '), print(Intentions1),
        select_action(Beliefs, Intentions1, Action),
        write('    Action: '), write(Action),
        execute(Action, S),
        write(' scores '), print(S),
        observe(Action, Observation),
        write('    Observation: '), print(Observation),
        update_beliefs(Observation, Beliefs, Beliefs1),
        write('    New Beliefs: '), print(Beliefs1),
        update_intentions(Belief, Intentions1, Intentions2),
        write('    New Intentions: '), print(Intentions2).


%  with probability 0.3, a new food item appears in random location on
the 10x10 grid

new_events(N, [food(X,Y,S)]) :-
        Prob is random(1),
        Prob =< 0.3, !,
        X is round(random(10)),
        Y is round(random(10)),
        S is round(random(10)),
        write('    Events: food value '), write(S), write(' appears at '),
write('('), write(X), write(','), write(Y), print(')'),
        assert(food(X, Y, S)).

new_events(N, []) :-
        print('    Events: none').


% execute action in the Tileworld -- always successfully!

execute(null, 0).

execute(eat(X,Y), S) :-
        retract(food(X, Y, S)),
        assert(eaten(X,Y)).

execute(move(X1,Y1), 0) :-
        retract(robot_at(U, V)),
        distance((U,V), (X1,Y1), 1),
        assert(robot_at(X1, Y1)).


% observe result of action -- always correctly!

observe(null, at(X,Y)) :-
        robot_at(X, Y).

observe(move(_,_), at(X,Y)) :-
        robot_at(X, Y).

observe(eat(_,_), eaten(X,Y)) :-
        retract(eaten(X,Y)).

Thanks.

Regards,
Joe

Joe,

Suggest you take this up with your TA. Doing your homework via the net does
not lead to personal growth.

BDI Agents with Matlab/Simulink

developed with Matlab/Simulink? Is there any chance to insert agents from other
frameworks (e.g. JADE)? Best Regards Sebastian JADEX ...
