Abstract

A crucially important adequacy test of any theory of speech acts is its ability to
handle performatives. This paper provides a theory of performatives as a test case for
our rationally based theory of illocutionary acts. We show why \I request you. . ." is a
request, and \I lie to you that p" is self-defeating. The analysis supports and extends
earlier work of theorists such as Bach and Harnish [1] and takes issue with recent claims
by Searle [10] that such performative-as-declarative analyses are doomed to failure.

1 Introduction
There is something special about performative sentences, sentences such as \I promise to
return": uttering them makes them true. How and when is this possible? Not all verbs
can be uttered in the rst-person present tense and thereby make the sentence true. In
general, the successful verbs seem to correspond to those naming illocutionary acts, but not

to perlocutionary ones such as \frighten." But, even some illocutionary verbs cannot be used
performatively: e.g., \I lie to you that I didn't steal your watch" is self-defeating [12]. So,
which verbs can be use performatively, and in Searle's words [10], \how do performatives
work?"
Any theory of illocutionary acts needs to provide a solution to questions such as these. But,
such questions are not merely of theoretical interest. Natural language database questionanswering systems have been known to receive performative utterances [14], dialogue systems
that recognize illocutionary acts (e.g., [6]) will need to infer the correct illocutionary force
to function properly, dialogue translation systems [5] will have to cope with markers of illocutionary force that function performatively (e.g., sentence nal particles in Japanese), and
proposals for \agent-oriented programming languages" [7, 13], as well as Winograd and Flores' [15] Coordinator system, are based on performative communication. For all these
systems, it is important to understand the semantics and pragmatics of such communicative
acts, especially their intended eects. To do so, one needs a full theory of illocutionary acts,
and a formal theory that predicts how utterances can be made true by uttering them.
The currently accepted theory of performatives is that they are in fact assertions, hence
true or false, and additionally constitute the performance of the named illocutionary act, in the
same way as an indirect reading of an illocutionary act is obtained from the direct illocutionary
act. That is, the named illocutionary act is derived from the assertion as an indirect speech
act. The most compelling defense of this performative-as-assertion analysis that we are aware
is that of Bach and Harnish [1], who address many of the linguistic phenomena discussed by
Sadock [9], but who, we believe, have misanalyzed indirect speech acts. However, in a recent
paper, Searle [10] forcefully criticizes the performative-as-assertion approach on the following
grounds:
 Assertions commit the speaker to the truth of what is asserted
 Performative statements are self-referential
 \An essential feature of any illocutionary act is the intention to perform that act"
Searle claims that accounts based on self-referential assertions are \doomed to failure" because
one cannot show that being committed to having the intention to be performing the named
illocutionary act entails that one in fact has that intention. Moreover, he questions that one
should derive the named illocutionary act from an assertion, rather than vice-versa. However,
Searle has imparted into Bach and Harnish's theory his notion of assertions as commitments
to the truth without providing a precise analysis of commitment. What may be doomed to
failure is any attempt to base an analysis of performatives on such a theory of assertions.
This paper provides a formal analysis of performatives that treats them as declarative
utterances, not initially as assertions, does not succumb to Searle's criticisms, and does not
require an entirely new class of illocutionary acts (the \declarations") as Searle and Vanderveken [12] have proposed. The analysis is oered as another adequacy criterion for our
theory of illocutionary acts. That theory, more fully explicated in [3], is based on an analysis of the individual rational balance agents maintain among their beliefs, goals, intentions,
commitments, and actions [2].
2

As desiderata for the theory of performatives, we demonstrate that the analysis meets two
properties:
 A sincere utterance of \I request you to open the door" is both a request and an
assertion, yet neither illocutionary act characterization is derived from the other.
 \I lie that the door is open" is self-defeating.
Briey, the ability to capture performatives is met almost entirely because such utterances are treated as indicative mood utterances, and because illocutionary acts are dened
as attempts. Since attempts depend on the speaker's beliefs, goals, and intentions, and these
mental states are introspectable in our theory, if a speaker sincerely says, for example, \I
request you to open the door," he must believe he did the act with the requisite beliefs, goals,
and intentions. Hence, the utterance is a request.
To meet the desiderata we need rst to present, albeit briey, the theory of rational
interaction, the treatment of declarative mood utterances, and then the illocutionary act
denitions for requesting and asserting. Finally, we combine the various analyses to analyze
performatives.

2 Abbreviated theory of rational action
Below, we give an abbreviated description of the theory of rational action upon which we
erect a theory of intention. The theory is cast in a modal logic of belief, goal, action, and
time. Further details of this logic can be found in [2].

2.1 Syntax

The language we use has the usual connectives of a rst-order language with equality, as well
as operators for the propositional attitudes and for talking about sequences of events: (BEL
x p) and (GOAL x p) say that p follows from x's beliefs or goals (a.k.a choices) respectively;
(AGT x e) says that x is the only agent for the sequence of events e; e1 e2 says that e1 is an
initial subsequence of e2 ; and nally, (HAPPENS a) and (DONE a) say that a sequence of events
describable by an action expression a will happen next or has just happened, respectively.
Versions of HAPPENS and DONE specifying the agent (x) are also dened.
An action expression here is built from variables ranging over sequences of events using the
constructs of dynamic logic [4]: a;b is action composition; ajb is nondeterministic choice; ajjb
is concurrent occurrence of a and b; p? is a test action; and nally, a is repetition. The usual
programming constructs such as IF/THEN actions and WHILE loops, can easily be formed from
these. Because test actions occur frequently in our analysis, yet create considerable confusion,
read p?;a as \action a occurring when p holds," and for a;p?, read \action a occurs after which
p holds." We use e as a variable ranging over sequences of events, and a and b for action
expressions.
We adopt the following abbreviations and domain predicates.
3

(BEFORE a p) def
= (DONE p?;a)1
(AFTER a p) def
= (HAPPENS a;p?)

3 def
= 9e (HAPPENS e;p?).
p

(LATER p) def
= :p ^ 3p.
2p def
= :3:p.

(PRIOR p q) def
= 8c (HAPPENS c;q?)  9a (a  c) ^ (HAPPENS a;p?).

The proposition p will become true no later than q.
(KNOW x p) def
= p ^ (BEL x p).
(IMPERATIVE s) means that sentence s is an imperative.
(DECLARATIVE s) means that sentence s, a string of words, is a declarative.
(MAIN-VERB s v), (TENSE s tense), (COMPLEMENT s s'), (D-OBJECT s np), (SUBJECT
s np), are all syntactic predicates intended to have the obvious meanings.2
(TRUE s e) means that sentence s is true with respect to some event sequence e
(which we will say has just been done.)
(REFERS np x e) means that noun phrase np refers to thing x with respect to event
e.
(FULFILL-CONDS s e e') means that event e fullls the satisfaction conditions, relative to event e', that are imposed by sentence s.3 For example, if s is \wash the
oor," e would be a oor-washing event.

2.2 Assumptions

The model we are developing embodies various assumptions constraining beliefs and choices
(goals). First, BEL has a \weak S5" semantics, and GOAL has a \system K" semantics.4
Among the remaining assumptions, the following will be used in this paper.5
Beliefs imply choice: j= (BEL x p)  (GOAL x p).
This means that agents choose amongst worlds that are compatible with their beliefs.
Goals are known: j=(GOAL x p)  (BEL x (GOAL x p)).
Memory: j= (DONE x (BEL x p)?;e)  (BEL x (DONE x (BEL x p)?;e)).
That is, agents remember what their beliefs were.
This diers from the BEFORE relation described in [3], which is here labelled PRIOR.
Feel free to substitute your favorite syntactic predicates.
3
TRUE REFERS, and FULFILL-CONDS are just placeholders for semantic theories of truth, reference, and
the meanings of imperatives, respectively. Their last event arguments would be used only in the interpretation
of indexicals.
4
See other work of ours [2] for a full model theory.
5
In other words, we only deal with semantic structures where these propositions come out true.

3 Individual Commitments and Intentions
To capture one grade of commitment that an agent might have toward his goals, we dene
a persistent goal, P-GOAL, to be one that the agent will not give up until he thinks certain
conditions are satised. Specically, we have

Denition 1 (P-GOAL x p q) def
=
(1) (BEL x :p) ^
(2) (GOAL x (LATER p)) ^
(3) [KNOW x

(PRIOR [(BEL x p)_(BEL x 2:p)_(BEL x :q)]
:[GOAL x (LATER p)])].

That is, the agent x believes p is currently false, chooses that it be true later, and knows that
before abandoning that choice, he must either believe it is true, believe it never will be true,
or believe q, an escape clause (used to model subgoals, reasons, etc.) is false.
Intention is a species of persistent goal. We analyze two kinds of intentions, those to do
actions and those to achieve propositions. Accordingly, we dene INTEND1 and INTEND2 to
take action expressions and propositions as arguments, respectively.
Denition 2 Intention:
(INTEND1 x a q) def
= (P-GOAL x [DONE x (BEL x (HAPPENS a))?;a] q).
def
(INTEND2 x p q) = (P-GOAL x 9e[HAPPENS x
(BEL x 9e' (HAPPENS x e';p?))?;e;p?] q)

Intending to do an action a or achieve a proposition p is a special kind of commitment (i.e.,
persistent goal) to having done the action a or having achieved p.6 However, it is not a simple
commitment to having done a or e;p? for that would allow the agent to be committed to doing
something accidentally or unknowingly. Instead, we require that the agent be committed to
arriving at a state in which he believes he is about to do the intended action next.
This completes a brief discussion of the foundational theory of intention and commitment.
Next, we proceed to dene the more specic concepts needed for analyzing communicative
action.

4 Utterance Events
We begin the analysis of utterance events by adopting a Gricean correlation of an utterance's
features (e.g., syntactic mood or sentence-nal particles in Japanese) with the speaker's mental state, termed a \core attitude" in [3, 8]. Very roughly, a declarative utterance s will be
correlated with the speaker's believing the uttered sentence is true, and an imperative utterance will be correlated with the speaker's wanting the addressee to do some action that
fullls the conditions imposed by the sentence. Let us notate these correlations as:
6

For simplicity, we omit here one condition from the denition of INTEND2 in [2].

5

DECLARATIVE ) (BEL x (TRUE s e))
IMPERATIVE ) (GOAL x 39e' (DONE y e') ^ (FULFILL-CONDS s e' e)

We formalize this notation below.
Someone who thinks he is observing an utterance event will come to believe the speaker
is in the correlated mental state, unless he has other beliefs to the contrary. For example,
if the observer thinks the speaker is lying, he believes that the speaker does not believe the
uttered sentence is true. But, because he may think the speaker takes himself to be especially
convincing, the observer may still believe that the speaker thinks the observer is deceived.
Hence, he would believe the speaker thinks that he thinks the speaker believes p.
This type of reasoning can continue to further levels. In general, if an utterance is produced
when there are no countervailing observer beliefs at a certain level of nesting, then the result
will be, at the given level of nesting, that the speaker is taken to be in the correlated mental
state [8]. To be able to state such conditions, we need to be able to refer easily to what a
person x believes about what y believes about what x believes etc., to arbitrary depths. To
do so, we use the notion of ABEL.

Denition 3 (ABEL n x y p) def
= |(BEL x (BEL y ({zBEL x . . .(BEL x} p )| .{z. .)}
n

n

That is, ABEL characterizes the nth alternating belief between x and y that p, built up \from
outside in," i.e, starting with x's belief that p. On this basis, one can dene unilateral mutual
belief | what one agent believes is mutually believed | as follows.

Denition 4 (BMB x y p) def
= 8n(ABEL n x y p)
In other words, (BMB x y p) is the innite conjunction (BEL x p) ^ (BEL x (BEL y p)) ^ . . .
Finally, we dene mutual belief and mutual knowledge as follows.

Denition 5 (MB x y p) def
= (BMB x y p) ^ (BMB y x p).
(MK x y p) def
= p ^ (MB x y p).

Utterance events can produce eects at any (or no) level of alternating belief. For example,
the speaker may not be trying to communicate anything to an intended observer. Illocutionary
acts will be dened to require that the speaker intend to produce BMBs, that is, beliefs at
all levels. In what follows, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between utterance
events and full-blooded communicative acts.

4.1 Notation for Describing Utterance Events

We now provide a formal notation for this correlation of utterance form and the speaker's
mental state as a kind of default axiom (cf. [8]). First, we specify who is speaking (spkr),
who is observing (obs, which includes the speaker and addressee, but also others), who is
6

being addressed (addr), and what kind of sentence (s) has been spoken (indicated by ). We
shall assume that everyone knows that a given utterance is of a given syntactic type (e.g.,
declarative), that speakers and addressees are observers, and that observers are known by all
to be observing.7

Denition 6  )  def
=
8 spkr, obs, addr, e, s, n

(KNOW obs (DONE spkr e) ^ (UTTER spkr addr s e) ^ ( s)) ^
(ABEL n obs spkr
(BEFORE e
(GOAL spkr
[AFTER e
(KNOW addr (BEFORE e ))]) )) 
(ABEL n obs spkr
(BEFORE e
 ^ (GOAL spkr
[AFTER e
(KNOW addr (BEFORE e ))]) ))

That is,  )  is an abbreviation for a quantied implication roughly to the eect that
if an observer obs knows that e was just done, where e was an uttering to addressee addr of a
sentence s in syntactic mood , and obs does not believe that e was done when the speaker
did not want the addressee to come to know that the core speaker-attitude  associated with
utterances of that type held, then obs believes that the speaker in fact wanted the addressee
to know that , and so he, the observer, believes that  held just prior to the utterance. The
notation states that at each level of alternating belief for which the antecedent holds, so does
the consequent. The symbol `)' can now be understood as a textual-replacement \macro"
operator.
Since these correlations are of the form 8nP(n)  Q(n), they imply 8nP(n)  8nQ(n). As
we quantify over the positive integers indicating levels of alternative belief, we can derive
the conclusion that under certain circumstances, addr thinks it is mutually believed (in our
notation, BMB'ed) that the speaker spkr wants addr to know  was true.
Notice that right after the utterance, we are concerned with what mental state the observer
thinks the speaker chose to bring about in the observer with that utterance. That is, the
condition on utterance events involves the speaker's wanting to get the observer to know
something, Without this temporal dimension, our performative analysis would fail. The
analysis of performatives will say that after having uttered such a sentence, or while uttering
it, the speaker believes he has just done or is doing the named illocutionary act. Typically,
prior to uttering a performative, the speaker has not just performed that speech act, and so
he would believe his having just done so is false. So, if the condition on utterance events in
Domain Axiom 1A involved only what the speaker believed or wanted to be true prior to the
7

The case of unseen observers is straightforward, but omitted here.

7

utterance, rather than after, all performatives would fail to achieve the observer's coming to
believe anything.
We can now state the correlation between utterance form and a speaker's mental state as
a domain axiom.
Domain Axiom 1 Declaratives and Imperatives:
A. j=DECLARATIVE ) (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))
B. j= IMPERATIVE ) (GOAL x 39e'(DONE y e') ^ (FULFILL-CONDS s e' e)
Below, we present our denitions of illocutionary acts. Further justication can be found in
[3].

5 Illocutionary Acts as Attempts
Searle [11] points out that an essential condition for requesting is that the speaker be attempting to get the addressee to perform the requested action. We take this observation one step
further and dene all illocutionary acts as attempts, hence dened in terms of the speaker's
mental states. Attempts involve both types of goal states, GOAL (merely chosen) and INTEND
(chosen with commitment), as noted below.

Denition 7 fATTEMPT x e p q t1g def
=

t1 ?;[(BEL x p ^ q) ^
(INTEND1 x t1 ?;e;p? (GOAL x 3q)) ^
(GOAL x 3q)]?; e

That is, an attempt to achieve q via p is a complex action expression in which x is the agent
of event e at time t1, and prior to e the agent believes p and q are both false, chooses that q
should eventually be true, and intends, relative to that choice, that e should produce p. So,
q represents some ultimate goal that may or may not be achieved by the attempt, while p
represents what it takes to make an honest eort.

5.1 Denitions of Request and Assert

To characterize a request or, for that matter, any illocutionary action, we must decide on the
appropriate formulas to substitute for p and q in the denition of an attempt. We constrain
illocutionary acts to be those in which the speaker is committed to understanding, that is,
to achieving a state of BMB that he is in a certain mental state. Below is a denition of a
speaker's requesting an addressee to achieve p.

Denition 8 fREQUEST spkr addr e p t1g def
=
fATTEMPT spkr e

8

[BMB addr spkr (BEFORE e
(GOAL spkr 3p ^
[AFTER e (INTEND2 addr p [(GOAL spkr 3p) ^
(HELPFUL addr spkr)] )])]]
9e' (DONE addr e';p?)
t1g

That is, event e is a request at time t1 if it is an attempt at that time to get the addressee to
achieve some condition p while being committed to making public that the speaker wanted:
rst, that p eventually be achieved; and second, that the addressed party should intend to
achieve it relative to the speaker's wanting it achieved and relative to the addressee's being
helpfully disposed towards the speaker.
The illocutionary act of asserting will be dened as an attempt to make the speaker's
believing the propositional content mutually believed.

Denition 9 fASSERT spkr addr e p t1g def=
fATTEMPT spkr addr e

[BMB addr spkr
(BEFORE e [GOAL spkr
(AFTER e
[KNOW addr (BEFORE e (BEL spkr p))])])]
[BMB addr spkr (BEFORE e (BEL spkr p))]

t1 g

More precisely, assertions at time t1 are dened as attempts in which to make an \honest
eort," the speaker is committed to getting the addressee to believe that it is mutually
believed that the speaker wanted prior to the utterance that the addressee would come to
know that the speaker believed p held then. That is, just like a request, an assertion makes
public that the speaker wants the addressee to know what mental state he was in. Although
he is committed to that, what the speaker has chosen to achieve is not merely to make public
his goal that the addressee know what mental state he was in, but to make public that he
was in fact in that state of believing p. For an INFORM, the speaker would choose to achieve
(KNOW addr p).

6 Performatives
To illustrate how performatives work, we show when both assertions and requests can be
derived from the utterance of the performative \I request you to <do act>." The important
point to notice here is that we have not had to add to our machinery; performative utterances
will be treated exactly as declarative utterances, with the exception that the content of the
utterance will make reference to an utterance event.
9

6.1 Request Reports

Let us characterize the truth conditions of the family of declarative sentences \x requests y to
himperative sentence s'i." Let s be such a sentence. Let  be 9e1 (DONE y e1) ^ (FULFILL-CONDS
s' e1 e). We ignore most syntactic considerations and indexicality for reasons of space.

Domain Axiom 2 Present tense requests

j= 8x, y, e, t1, (DONE t1 ?;e) ^ (SUBJECT s x) ^ (D-OBJECT s y) ^
(REFERS x x e) ^ (REFERS y y e) 
(TRUE s e)  (DONE x fREQUEST x y e  t1 g)
That is, if event e was just done and the sentence s was a present tense declarative sentence
whose main verb is \request," whose subject x refers to person x, and whose direct object y
refers to person y, then the sentence is true i x just requested the addressee y to fulll the
conditions of imperative sentence s'. A bare present (or present progressive) tense sentence
is true when the event being described is contemporaneous with the event of uttering it.8
This denition applies equally well to \John requests Mary to . . ." as it does when I utter
\I request you to . . ." For the former, such sentences are likely to be narrations of ongoing
events.9 For the latter, the event that is happening that makes the utterance true is the
speaker's uttering of the sentence.
By our denition of request, for x to request y to achieve p, x has to attempt to get y to
do some action intentionally to fulll the sentence s', by making that goal mutually believed
between them. Thus, to say x requested y to do something is only to say that x had the right
beliefs, goals, and intentions.

6.2 Performatives Used as Requests

Next, we treat performative sentences as declaratives. This means that the eects of uttering them are described by Domain Axiom 1A. We sketch below a proof of a general theorem regarding performative requests, with s being the declarative sentence \I request you to
himperative sentence s1i, and  being 9e1 (DONE addr e1) ^ (FULFILL-CONDS s1 e1 e). We take
the uttering of a sentence to be a unitary utterance event.

Theorem 1 A Performative Request
j=8 spkr, addr, e, n, t1,

(MK spkr addr (DONE spkr t1?;e) ^
(UTTER spkr addr e s)) ^
(BEFORE t1?;e
(GOAL spkr [AFTER t1 ?;e
8
Searle [10] correctly points out that performatives can be uttered in the passive, and in the rst-person
plural.
9
We are ignoring the habitual reading of bare present tense sentences because we do not have a semantics
for them.

10

(KNOW addr
[BEFORE t1?;e (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))])])) 
(DONE fREQUEST spkr addr e  t1 g)

That is, we need to show that if the sentence \I request you to <imperative sentence>" has
just been uttered at time t1 sincerely, i.e., when the speaker wanted the addressee to know
that he believed the sentence was true, then a direct request has taken place at t1 .
Proof sketch: Essentially, one invokes the domain axiom for declaratives at the rst level
of ABEL, entailing that the speaker believes that he believes that he has just done a REQUEST.
Then, one expands the denition of REQUEST into an ATTEMPT, and then into its parts. The
denition of ATTEMPT is based on BEL, GOAL and INTEND, the rst two of which are obviously
introspectable. That is, if one believes one has them one does, and vice-versa. Hence, by the
memory assumption, the speaker actually had them prior to the utterance. More critically,
intending to act at time t1 is also introspectable at time t1 because agents know what they are
doing at the next instant and because there is no time to drop their commitment [2]. Thus,
one can repackage these mental states up into an ATTEMPT and then a REQUEST.

6.3 Performatives Used as Assertions

We have shown that the speaker of a sincere performative utterance containing an illocutionary verb has performed the illocutionary act named by that verb. Under somewhat stronger
conditions, we can also prove that the speaker has made an assertion. As before, let s be \I
request you to <imperative sentence>."
Theorem 2 Performatives Used as Assertions
j=8 spkr, addr, e, n, t1,
(MK spkr addr (DONE spkr t1?;e) ^ (UTTER spkr addr e s)) ^
[BEFORE e (BEL spkr
[AFTER e
8n(ABEL n addr spkr
(BEFORE e
(GOAL spkr
[AFTER e
(KNOW addr [BEFORE e (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))]]
(DONE spkr fASSERT spkr addr (TRUE s e) t1 g)

This default condition says that before the utterance, the speaker believed there would
be no addressee belief after the utterance event (at any level n) to the eect that prior to
that event the speaker did not want the addressee to come to know that the speaker believed
(TRUE s e). Given Domain Axiom 1A, and the fact that BEL entails GOAL, this suces to
entail the denition of assertion. Notice that whereas requesting was derived in virtue of the
content of the utterance, an assertion was derived by default assumptions regarding lack of
belief in the speaker's insincerity.

7 `Lie' is not a performative
Some illocutionary verbs such as \lie," \hint," \insinuate," cannot be achieved performatively.
The following analysis shows a general model for why such verbs naming covert acts cannot
be performatively achieved.
A reasonable denition of lying is the following complex action:

Denition 10 fLIE spkr addr e pg def= (BEL spkr p)?;fASSERT spkr addr e p t1g
That is, a lie is an assertion performed when the speaker believes the propositional content
is false.
For \I lie to you that the door is open" to be a successful performative utterance, it would
have to be true that the utterance is a lie. We would have to show that the uttering of that
declarative sentence results in a lie's having been done. More generally, we provide a putative
statement of the truth conditions of \x lies to y that <declarative sentence s'> ." Call the
main sentence s.

Domain Axiom 3 Supposed Truth Conditions for Performative Lying
j= 8e, x, y, t1, (DONE t1 ?;e) ^ (REFERS x x e) ^ (REFERS y y e) 
(TRUE s e)  (DONE fLIE x y e (TRUE s' e) t1 g )

That is, if s and s' are declarative sentences of the appropriate syntactic form, x refers to x
and y refers to y, then s is true i in performing it at time t1 , x was lying that sentence s' is
true.
So we can prove the following. Let the sentence s be \I lie to you that <declarative
sentence s'>."
Theorem 3 Lies are not performative
j=8 spkr, addr, e, n
(MK spkr addr [(DONE spkr t1?;e) ^ (UTTER spkr addr e s)]) 
(DONE fLIE spkr addr e (TRUE s e) t1 g)
In other words, you cannot perform a lie by saying \I lie that . . ."
Proof Sketch: Assume that it is mutually believed that the speaker has uttered declarative
sentence s. Now, apply Domain Axiom 1A. By assumption, the rst conjunct of the antecedent
holds. There are then two cases to consider. First, assume (**) the second conjunct holds (say,
at level n = 1), i.e., the addressee does not believe the speaker did not want him to know that
he believed s' was true. In virtue of the supposed truth conditions on lying, spkr would have
to have been lying. By expanding its denition, and using the memory and introspectability
properties of BEL, GOAL, and INTEND the addressee can conclude that, before the utterance,
the speaker wanted him not to know that the speaker believes that in uttering S, he was lying.
But, this contradicts the assumption (**). Since the speaker in fact uttered the sentence, that
assumption is false, and the addressee believes the speaker did not in fact want him to know
12

that he believed the sentence was true. This renders impossible the intentions to be achieved
in asserting, which are constitutive of lying as well.
Now, assume (**) is false, so the addressee in fact believes the speaker did not want him
to know that s' was true. Again, this immediately makes the speaker's intentions in asserting,
and hence lying, impossible to achieve. So, in neither case is the utterance a lie. If the
addressee believes the speaker is a competent speaker of the language, the speaker must have

8 Conclusion
Requesting works well as a performative verb because requesting requires only that the agent
has made an attempt, and need not have succeeded in getting the hearer to do the requested
action, or even to form the right beliefs. Some verbs cannot be used performatively, such as
\frighten," because they require something beyond a mere attempt. Hence, such verbs would
name action expressions that required a particular proposition p be true after the utterance
event. When the utterance event does not guarantee such a p, the use of the performative
verb will not be possible.
On the other hand, certain utterances (performative or not), when performed by the right
people in the right circumstances, make certain institutional facts hold. So, when a clergyman,
judge, or ship captain says \I now pronounce you husband and wife," the man and woman in
question are married. In our framework, there would be a domain axiom whose antecedent
characterizes the circumstances, participants, and nature of the utterance event, and whose
consequent asserts that an institutional fact is true. The axiom is justied not by the nature
of rational action, but by the existence of an institution. Such utterances could be made with
a performative prex provided such attempts are made into successes by the institution.
This paper has shown that treating performative utterances as declarative sentences is a
viable analysis, in spite of Searle's criticisms. The performative use of an illocutionary verb
is self-guaranteeing when the named illocutionary act consists in the speaker's making an
attempt to make public his mental state. In such cases, if the speaker thinks he has done so,
then he has. However, we do not derive the named illocutionary act from the assertion, nor
vice-versa. Instead, both derivations may be made from the utterance event, but the assertive
one is in fact harder to obtain as it has extra conditions that need to be satised.

A Model Theory
A model M is a structure h; P; E; Agt; T; B; G; i, where  is a set, P is a set of people, E is
a set of primitive event types, Agt 2 [E ,! P ] species the agent of an event, T  [Z ,! E ]
is a set of possible courses of events (or worlds) specied as a function from the integers to
14

elements of E , B  T  P  Z  T is the belief accessibility relation, G  T  P  Z  T is
the goal accessibility relation, and  interprets predicates. Formulas will be evaluated with
respect to some possible course of events, hereafter some possible world, and an \index" into
that possible world, that is, at a particular point in the course of events.

A.1 Denitions

 D =  S P S E , specifying the domain of quantication. That is, one can quantify
over things, people, and sequences of (types of) primitive events. Given this,  
[Predk  T  Z  Dk ].
 AGT  E   P; where x 2 AGT [e1; . . . ; en] i there is an i such that x = Agt(ei): That
is, AGT species the partial agents of a sequence of events.

A.2 Satisfaction

Assume M is a model,  a sequence of events, n an integer, v a set of bindings of variables
to objects in D, and if v 2 [V ars ,! D], then vdx is that function which yields d for x and is
the same as v everywhere else. We now specify what it means for M; ; v; n to satisfy a w
, which we write as M; ; v; n j= . Because of formulas involving actions, this denition
depends on what it means for an expression a to occur between index points n and m. This,
we write as M; ; v; n[ a] m, and is itself dened in terms of satisfaction. The denitions are
as follows:10
1. M; ; v; n j= (BEL x p) i for all   such that B (; v (x); n;  ); M;  ; v; n j= p.
2. M; ; v; n j= (BMB x y p) i for all 1; . . . m such that 1 =  and B (2i,1 ; v (x); n; 2i)
and B (2i ; v (y); n; 2i+1) for every 1  i  m=2; we have that M; m ; v; n j= p. This is
one-sided mutual belief (that is, x thinks it is mutually believed).
3. M; ; v; n j= (GOAL x p) i for all   such that G(; v (x); n;  ); M;  ; v; n j= p.
4. M; ; v; n j= (AGT x1 . . . xk e) i v (e) = S1 S2 . . . Sm and fx j x = Agt(Sj )&e 2 Sj g =
fv(xj )g. Thus the xj are the only agents of e. One can easily dene inductively (AGT
x1 . . . xk a), where a is an arbitrary action expression.
5. M; ; v; n j= (e1  e2 ) i v (e1 ) starts v (e2 ):
6. M; ; v; n j= (HAPPENS a) i 9m; m  n; such that M; ; v; n[ a] m. That is, a describes
a sequence of events that happens \next" (after n).
7. M; ; v; n j= (DONE a) i 9m; m  n; such that M; ; v; m[ a] n. That is, a describes a
sequence of events that just happened (before n).
10

For conciseness, we omit that part of the denition that deals with the constructs of rst-order logic.

15

8. M; ; v; n j=(DOING a) i 9m  n and an n0  n such that m[ a] n0 . That is, the doing of
a overlaps the current time. Notice that (HAPPENS a) and (DONE a) both imply (DOING
a).
9. M; ; v; n j= hTime-Propositioni i hTime-Propositioni = n.
Turning now to the occurrence of actions, we have:
1. M; ; v; n[ e] n + m (where e is an event variable) i v (e) = S1S2 . . . Sm and Si   (n +
i); 1  i  m: Intuitively, e denotes some sequence of events of length m which appears
next after n in the world  .
2. M; ; v; n[ a; b] m i 9k; n  k  m, such that M; ; v; n[ a] k and M; ; v; k[ b] m. The
action described by a and then that described by b occurs.
3. M; ; v; n[ a j b] m i M; ; v; n[ a] m or M; ; v; n[ b] m. Either the action described by a
or that described by b occurs within the interval.
4. M; ; v; n[ a jj b] m i M; ; v; n[ a] m and M; ; v; n[ b] m. That is, both the action described by a and that described by b occur during the interval.
5. M; ; v; n[ p?] n i M; ; v; n j= p. The test action, p?, involves no events at all, but
occurs if p holds, or \blocks" (fails), when p is false.
6. M; ; v; n[ a ] m i 9n1 ; . . . ; nk where n1 = n and nk = m and for every i such that
1  i  k , 1, M; ; v; ni[ a] ni+1 .The iterative action a occurs between n and m
provided only a sequence of what is described by a occurs within the interval.
A w p is satisable if there is at least one M , world  , index n, and assignment v such that
M; ; v; nj= p. A w p is valid, i for every M , world , event index n, and assignment of
variables v , M; ; v; nj= p.

B.1 Performative Requests
Let s be \I request you to s1."

Theorem 1 A Performative Request
j=8 spkr, addr, e, n, t1,
(MK spkr addr (DONE spkr t1?;e) ^
(UTTER spkr addr e s)) ^
(BEFORE t1?;e

16

(GOAL spkr [AFTER t1 ?;e
(KNOW addr
[BEFORE t1?;e (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))])])) 
(DONE fREQUEST spkr addr e  t1 g)

Assume the antecedent is true. We rst apply the Domain Axiom 1A to the utterance
event, and note that if spkr has just done an utterance event, he believes he has done it (see
[2]), meaning the speaker is also an observer of the event. Therefore, we have (at level n=1
of the ABEL)
(1) (DONE spkr t1?;e) ^ (BEL spkr (BEFORE e (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))) is true.
By Domain Axiom 1A, this implies
(2) (DONE spkr spkr t1 ?;e) ^

(BEL spkr [BEFORE spkr e (BEL spkr (DONE t1 ?;fREQUEST spkr addr e g))]),

That is, an event e is being performed by spkr, and spkr thinks spkr believed he has just done a
direct request to fulll the embedded imperative sentence. By expanding out REQUEST into
an ATTEMPT, we see that (2) entails
(3) (BEL spkr (BEFORE spkr e
where

[BEL spkr (DONE spkr
t1 ?;fATTEMPT spkr addr e (BMB addr spkr (GOAL spkr  ))  t1g],

 def
= 3 ^ [AFTER spkr e (INTEND2 addr  [(GOAL spkr 3) ^
(HELPFUL addr spkr)])], and
 def
= 9e2 (DONE addr e2 ) ^ (FULFILL-CONDS s e2 e)
Next, by the memory and introspectibility properties of BEL and by expanding the denition
of ATTEMPT in (3), we get (4)

(4) (BEFORE e [BEL spkr

(DONE t1 ?;[(BEL spkr   ^  ) ^
[INTEND1 spkr t1 ?;e2;(BMB addr spkr (GOAL spkr  ))?
(GOAL spkr 3) ]

17

(GOAL spkr 3) ]; e)])

Now, in virtue of the introspection properties of GOAL, and noting that an agent who thinks
at time t1 that he intends at time t1 to do an action at time t1 INTEND1 in fact has that
intention, spkr knew what his intentions were as well. Therefore, we have:
(5) (DONE t1 ?;[(BEL spkr   ^  ) ^
[INTEND1 spkr t1 ?;e2;(BMB addr spkr (GOAL spkr  ))?
(GOAL spkr 3) ]
(GOAL spkr 3) ]; e)])

So, we have
(5) (DONE spkr t1?;fREQUEST spkr addr e  t1 g;)
Q.E.D.
All these conclusions are, of course, true right after the performative sentence has been
uttered.

B.2 Lying is not performative
Let s be \I lie to you that s'".

Theorem 3 Lies are not performative
j=8 spkr, addr, e, n

(MK spkr addr [(DONE spkr t1?;e) ^ (UTTER spkr addr e s)]) 
(DONE fLIE spkr addr e (TRUE s e) t1 g)

Proof:11
Let 	 def
= (BEL addr (BEFORE spkr e (BEL spkr (TRUE s e)))) ^
[BEFORE e (BEL spkr  (TRUE s e))].12.
To begin, assume the antecedent to Domain Axiom 1A holds at level n = 1, meaning that
the addressee does not suspect the speaker of insincerity. That is, assume
(*) (BEL n addr spkr [BEFORE spkr e
(GOAL spkr [AFTER spkr e
11
12

The part of the formula to be operated upon next will appear in italics.
Notice that 	 entails (KNOW addr [BEFORE spkr e (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))])

18

So, at level n = 1, by Domain Axiom 1A
(1) (BEL addr [BEFORE spkr e

(KNOW addr [BEFORE spkr e
(BEL spkr (TRUE s e))]]

(GOAL spkr [AFTER spkr e
(KNOW addr
(BEFORE spkr e [BEL spkr (True s e)]))] holds.

That is, the addressee thinks the speaker wanted him to come to know that the speaker believes the \I lie . . ." sentence is true. In virtue of the supposed truth conditions of performative
lying, he wanted the addressee to know that he lied.
(2) (BEL addr [BEFORE spkr e
(GOAL spkr
[AFTER spkr e
(KNOW addr
(BEFORE spkr e
[BEL spkr
(DONE spkr t1?;fLIE spkr addr e (TRUE s' e)g],

So, by the denition of LIE, the expansion of the INTEND1 argument to the ATTEMPT in its
denition, and the rst expansion of BMB, and we conclude
(3) (BEL addr
[BEFORE spkr e
(GOAL spkr
[AFTER spkr e
(KNOW addr
[BEFORE spkr e

(BEL spkr
(BEL spkr (TRUE s' e)) ^
[GOAL spkr (AFTER spkr e 	) ]

19

By Assumptions 2 and 3, if spkr thinks he had those BEL and GOALs, then he did. This entails
(4) (BEL addr
(BEFORE spkr e
(GOAL spkr
[AFTER spkr e
(KNOW addr
[BEFORE spkr e
(BEL spkr (TRUE s' e)) ^
(GOAL spkr (AFTER spkr e 	)) ]

Therefore, by the denition of KNOW, we have
(5) (BEL addr
[BEFORE spkr e
(GOAL spkr

[AFTER spkr e [BEFORE spkr e
(BEL spkr (TRUE s' e)) ^

(GOAL spkr (AFTER spkr e 	)) ]

Now, (AFTER spkr e (BEFORE e )) entails , so we have,
(6) (BEL addr [ BEFORE spkr e (GOAL spkr (GOAL spkr (AFTER spkr e 	) ]
and (GOAL spkr (GOAL spkr )) entails (GOAL spkr ), so we have
(7) (BEL addr
[BEFORE spkr e

20

(BEL spkr (TRUE s' e)) ^
(GOAL spkr (AFTER spkr e 	))])

This entails:
(8) (BEL addr
[BEFORE spkr e
(GOAL spkr (AFTER spkr e
(KNOW addr [BEFORE spkr e (BEL spkr (TRUE s' e))])]

This contradicts the assumption in Domain Axiom 1A. Thus, we can conclude that the
assumed antecedent (*) is false, i.e.,
(BEL addr spkr
[BEFORE spkr e
(GOAL spkr [AFTER spkr e
(KNOW addr (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))]].

But this contradicts the intention constitutive of asserting, and hence lying.
In the same fashion, if the second conjunct of the antecedent of Domain Axiom 1A is false,
we immediately arrive at the same contradiction. Hence, the utterance is not a lie. Q.E.D.
