Abstract

I.

This paper provides a logical analysis of the concept
of intention as composed of two more basic concepts,
choice (or goal) and commitment.
By making explicit the conditions under which an agent can drop
her goals, i.e., by specifying how the agent is conznzitted to her goals, the formalism provides analyses for
Bratman’s three characteristic functional roles played
by intentions [Bratman, 19863, a.nd shows how agents
can avoid intending all the foreseen side-effects of what
they actually intend. Finally, the analysis shows how
intentions can be adopted relative to a background
of relevant beliefs and other intentions or goals. By
relativizing one agent’s intentions in terms of beliefs
about another agent’s intentions (or beliefs), we derive
a preliminary account of interpersonal commitments.
By now, it is obvious to all interested
parties that
autonomous
agents need to infer the intentions
of other
agents-in
order to help those agents, hinder them, communicate
with them, and in general to predict their behavior. Although intent and plan recognition
has become
a major topic of research for computational
linguistics
and
distributed
artificial intelligence,
little work has addressed
what it is these intentions
are. Earlier work equated intentions with plans [Allen and Perrault,
1980, Cohen and
Perrault,
1979, Schmidt
et al., 1978, Sidner and Israel,
19811, and recent work [Pollack,
19861 has addressed the
collection
of mental states agents would have in having a
plan. However, many properties
of intention
are left out,
properties
that an observer
can make good use of. For
example,
knowing that an agent is intending
to achieve
something,
and seeing it fail, an observer
may conclude
that the agent is likely to try again. This pa,per provides
a formal foundation
for making such predictions.

Intention

as

a

Composite

We model intention as a composite concept specifying what
the agent has chosen and how the agent is committed to
that choice. First, consider agents as choosing from among
their (possibly inconsistent)
desires those they want most.4
Call what that follows from these chosen desires, loosely,
goals. Next, consider an agent to have a persistent goal if
she has a. goal that she believes currently
to be false, and
that remains chosen at least as long as certain conditions
hold. Persistence
involves an agent’s internnl commitment
over time to her choices.” In the simplest case, a “fanatic”
will drop her commitment
only if she believes the goal has
been a.chieved or is impossible to achieve. Finally, intentior
is modelled a.s a kind of persistent
goal-a
persistent
goal
to do an action, believing one is about to do it.
Both beliefs and goals are modelled here in terms of
possible worlds.
Thus, our formalism
does not deal with
the actual chosen desires of an agent directly,
but only
with what is true in all chosen worlds, that is, worlds that
are compatible
with those desires.
As usual, this type of
coarse-grained
model will not distinguish
between logically
equivalent
goals (or beliefs).
Moreover,
we assume that
these chosen worlds are all compatible
with the beliefs of
an agent, which is to say that if she has chosen worlds in
which p holds, and she believes that p implies q, then she
has chosen worlds in which q holds.
Despite these severe closure conditions,
a crucial property of intention
that our model does capture
is that an
agent may or ma.y not intend the expected
consequences
of her intentions.
Consider
the case of taking a drug to
cure an illness, believing that as a side-effect,
one will upset one’s stomach.
In choosing to take the drug, the agent
has surely deliberately
chosen stomach distress.
But that
was not her intention;
she is not committed
to upsetting
her stomach.
Sl~oulcl she take a new and improved version of the drug that does not upset her stomach,
all the
better.6
A system that cannot distinguish
between the two
cases is likely to be more of a hindrance
than a help.
In the next sections of the paper we briefly develop elements of a forma.1 theory of rational action, leading up to

can be built out of the former.

It remains to be seen if the latter

as her indicator that the drug was effective, then if her stomach were
not upset after taking the drug, she would ask for a refund.

goals. Then, we discuss the logic
of persistent
goal and define a notion of intention.
We also
extend the concept of a persistent
goal to a more general
one-one
in which the dependencies
of the agent’s commitments
can depend on arbitrary
propositions.
Finally,
we lead up to a theory of rational
interact ion and communication
by showing how agents can have interlocking
commitments.

Below, we give an abbreviated
description
of the theory of
rational action upon which we erect a theory of intention.
Further
details of this logic can be found in [Cohen and
Levesque,
19871.
A.

Syntax

The language we will use has the usual connectives
of a
first-order
language with equality, as well as operators
for
the propositional
attitudes
and for talking about sequences
of events: (BEL x p) and (GOAL x p) say that x has p as a
belief or goal respectively;
(AGT x e) says that x is the
only agent of the sequence of events e; else2 says that ei
is an initial subsequence
of e2; and finally, (HAPPENS
a)
by
and (DONE a) say that a sequence of events describable
an action expression
a will happen next or just happened
respectively.
An action expression
here is built from variables ranging over sequences of events using the constructs
of dynamic logic: a;b is action composition;
alb is nondeterministic
choice; p? is a test action; and finally, a* is repetition.
The usual programming
constructs
like IF/THEN
actions and WHILE loops can easily be formed from these.
We will use e as a variable ranging over sequences of events,
and a and b for action expressions.
For simplicity, we adopt a logic with no singular terms,
using instead predicates
and existential
quantifiers.
However, for readability,
we will often use constants.
The interested reader can expand these out into the full predicative
form if desired.

B.

Semantics

We shall adapt the usual possible-worlds
model for belief to
goals and events.
Informally,
a possible world is a string
of events temporally
extended
infinitely
in the past and
future, and characterizing
a possible way the world could
have been and could be.
Because
things will naturally
change over a course of events, the truth of a proposition
in our language depends not only on the world in question,
but on an index into that course of events (roughly, a time
point).

5, B(o,z,
n, a*) holds if the world O* is compatible
with
what x believes in world o at point n (and similarly for G
and goals).
Turning this around, we could say that a Gaccessible world is any course of events that an agent would
be satisfied with, and that goals are just those propositions
that are true in all such worlds (and analogously
for beliefs).
Finally, to complete
the semantic picture,
we need a
domain of quantification
D that includes all people and
finite sequences of events, and a relation @, which at every
world and index point assigns to each k-place predicate
symbol a k-ary relation over D. These sets, functions,
and
relations together make up a semantic structure.
Assume that M is a semantic
structure,
a one of its
possible worlds, n an integer, and v a set of bindings of variables to objects
in D. We now specify what it means for
M, 0, v, n to satisfy a wff p, which we write as M, 0, v, n /=
p. Because
of formulas involving
actions,
this definition
depends on wha.t it means for a sequence
of events described by an action expression
a to occur between index
points n and m. This, we write as M,o, v, n[a]m, and is
itself defined in terms of satisfaction.
The definitions
are
as follows:7

3. M,(~,v,n
k (AGT x e) iff v(e) = e1e2.. . e, and for
every i, Agt(e;) = v(x). Thus x is the only agent of e.
4. M, O, v, n + (ei 5 e2) iff v(ei)

starts

v(e2).

5. M,a,v,n
k (HAPPENS
a) iff 3m, m > n, such that
M, o, v, nI[a]m.
That is, a describes
a sequence
of
events that happens “next” (after n).
6. M,c,v,n
/= (DONE
a) iff 3m,m
5 n, such that
M, CT,v, m[a]n.
That is, a describes
a sequence
of
events that just happened (before n).
Turning

now to the occurrence

of actions,

we have:

1. M, 0, v, n[e]n + m (where e is an event variable)
iff
v(e) = ele2...em
and a(n + i) = e;, 1 5 i < m. Intuitively, e denotes some sequence of events of length m
which appears next after n in the world O.
n[a; b]m iff Elk, n 5
k < m, such that
2. M,o,v,
M, O, v, n[a]k
and M, g, v, kl[blm.
The action
described by a and then that described
by b occurs.
3. M,v,nUa
I bl m iff M, 0, v, nUa]m or M, O, v, n[b]m.
Either the action described by a or that described by
b occurs within the interval.
4. M,a,v,n[p?jn
iff M, 0, v, n /= p. The test action, p?,
involves no events at all, but occurs if p holds, or
“blocks” (fails), when p is false.

some

and Assumptions

It is not too difficult to establish that action expressions
as
defined here have their dynamic logic interpretation.
For
example,
/= (HAPPENS

p?;(blc))

s [p A ((HAPPENS
(HAPPENS

b) V
c))].

So a test action followed by a nondeterministic
action happens iff the test is true and one of the two actions happens
next. Moreover,
HAPPENS
and DONE interact,
as in
k (HAPPENS
a) z (HAPPENS
a;(DONE
a)?)
b (DONE
a) s (DONE
(HAPPENS
a)?;a).
So, for example, if an action happens next, then immediately afterwards,
it is true that it just happened.
Note that there is a sharp distinction
between action
expressions
and primitive
events.
Examples
of the latter
might include moving an arm, exerting force, and uttering a word or sentence.
Action expressions
are used to
characterize
sequences of primitive
events that satisfy certain properties.
For example, a movement of a finger may
result in a circuit’s
being closed, which may result in a
event
light’s coming on. We will say that one primitive
happened,
which can be characterized
by various complex
action expressions.
Turning now to the attitudes,
they can be shown to
satisfy the usual closure conditions:
t= (BEL x p) A (BEL x (p > q)) > (BEL

ersistent

oals

To capture
one grade of commitment
(fanatical)
that an
agent might have toward her goals, we define a persistent
goal, P-GOAL,
to be one that the agent will not give up
until she thinks it has been satisfied, or until she thinks it
will never be true.ii
Specifically,
we have

are achievement
goals; the agent’s goal is that p be true
in the future, and she believes it is not currently
true. As
soon as the agent believes it will never be true, we know
the agent must drop her goal (by Realism),
and hence her

as soon as an agent believes

p is true, the belief conjunct
of P-GOAL requires that she
drop the persistent
goal that p be true. Thus, these conditions are necessary and sufficient for dropping a persistent
goal.
However, the BEFORE
conjunct
does not say that
an agent must give up her simple goal when she thinks it
is satisfied,
since agents may have goals of maintenance.

First, (P-GOAL x pAq) does not imply (P-GOAL x q) because,
although the antecedent
is true, the agent might believe q
is already true, and thus cannot have q as a P-GOAL.*’
Conversely, (P-GOAL x p) A (P-GOAL
x q) does not imply (PGOAL x pAq), b ecause (GOAL x (LATER p)) A (GOAL x (LATER
q)) does not imply (GOAL x (LATER pAq)); p and q could be
true at different times.
Similar analyses can be given for
the other properties
of P-GOAL.
We now give a crucial

theorem:

Theorem
1 From persistence
to eventualities-If
someone has a persistent goal of bringing about p, p is always
within her area of competence,
and the agent will only believe that p will never occur after she drops her goal, then
eventually p becomes true:
/= (P-GOAL
-[BEFORE

y p) A 0 (COMPETENT
(BEL y o-p)
-(GOAL

y p) A
x (LATER p))]

> Op.

If an agent who is not competent
with respect to p adopts
p as a persistent
goal, we cannot conclude that eventually
p
will be true, since she could forever create incorrect
plans.
If the goal is not persistent,
we also cannot conclude Op
since she could give up the goal without achieving it. If
the goal actually is impossible
for her to achieve, but she
does not know this and commits to achieving it, then we
know that eventually,
perhaps after trying hard to achieve
it, she will come to believe it is impossible
and give up.

As the formalism now stands, once an agent has adopted
a persistent
goal, she will not be deterred.
For example,
if agent z receives a request from agent y , and decides
to cooperate
by adopting
a persistent
goal to do the requested act, y cannot “turn x off.” This is clearly a defect
that needs to be remedied.
The remedy depends on the
following definition:
Definition
2 (P-R-GOAL

(GOAL x (LATER p)) A (BEL x wp) A

That is, a necessary
condition
to giving up a P-R-GOAL
is that the agent believes it is satisfied,
or believes it is
impossible
to achieve, or believes -9.
Such propositions
q form a background
that justifies
the agent’s intentions.
In many cases, such propositions
constitute
the agent’s
reasons for adopting the intention.
For example, an agent
could adopt the persistent
goal to buy an umbrella relative
to her belief that it will rain. That agent could consider
12For example, I may be committed to your knowing 4, but not to
achieving q itself.

dropping
her persistent
goal should she come to believe
that the forecast has changed.
One can prove a theorem analogous to Theorem
1: If
someone has a persistent
goal of bringing about p, relative
to q, and, before dropping her goal, p remains within her
area of competence,
and the agent will not believe that p
will never occur or believe that q is false, then eventually
p becomes true.
At this point, we are ready to define intention.
There
are two forms of intention-intending
actions and intending to achieve some state of affairs. For this brief paper, we
only present the former; see [Cohen and Levesque,
19871
for the latter.

Accordingly,
we deD1 to take an action expression

(P-GOAL

Let us examine what this says. First of all, (fanatically)
intending to do an action a is a special kind of commitment
(i.e., persistent
goal) to have done a. However, it is not
a commitment
just to doing a, for that would allow the
agent to be committed
to doing something
accidentally
or
unknowingly.
It seems reasonable
to require that the agent
be committed
to believing she is about to do the intended
action, and then doing it.
Secondly,
it is a commitment
to success-to
having
done the action.
As a contrast,
consider the following inadequate definition of INTENDI:
(INTEND1

x a))).

This would say that an intention is a commitment

the verge of doing something
is not the same as doing it;
any unforeseen obstacle could permanently
derail the agent
from ever performing
the intended act. This would not be
much of a commitment.
Just as we refined our analysis of persistent
goal to allow the commitment
to be relative to the agent’s believing
arbitrary
states-of-affairs,
so too can we extend the above
definition of intention:
Definition
(P-R-GOAL

4 (INTEND1
x a q) ‘!Zf
x [DONE x (KNOW
x (HAPPENS

a))?;a] q).

In this section we show how various properties
of the commonsense concept of intention
are captured
by our analysis based on P-GOAL.
First, we consider how our definitions characterize
the functional
roles that intentions
are
thought
to play in the mental lives of agents [Bratman,
1984, Bratman,
19861
Intentions
normally pose problems for the agent; the
agent needs to determine
a way to achieve them. If
the agent intends an action as described by an action
expression,
then she knows in general terms what to
do. However, the action expression
may have disjunctions or conditionals
in it. Hence, she need not know
at the time of forming the intention exactly what will
be done. But unless she comes to believe the action

is unachievable,
she must sooner or later correctly believe that she is about to do something
that accomplishes the action (by Theorem 1). Now by the Knowing Agents assumption,
a primitive
event will occur
only if its agent believes it will. So sooner or later,
the agent will decide on a specific thing to do. Thus,
agents are required to convert non-specific
intentions
into specific choices of primitive
events to that end.

If an agent has an intention
to do b, and the agent (always) believes that doing a
prevents the achievement
of b, then the agent cannot

doing a before doing b):

Thus our agents cannot intentionally
act to make their
persistent
goals unachievable.
For example,
if they
have adopted a tim,e-limited
intention,
they cannot
intend to do some other act knowing it would make

tions after failure.
Assume an agent has an intention
to do a, and then does something,
b, thinking it would
bring about the doing of a, but then comes to believes
it did not. If the agent does not think that a can never
be done, the agent still have the intention
to do a:

Because an agent cannot give up an intention until it is
believed to have been achieved or to be unachievable,
the agent here keeps the intention.

that the agent knowingly chooses to upset her stomach without intending to do so is accomodated
in our
scheme since (INTEND1

not imply (INTEND1

The reason is that alaccomthough there is a belief that p is inevitably
panied by q, this belief could change over time (for
example, if the agent finds out about new medicine).
Under these circumstances,
although p remains a persistent goal, q can now be realistically
dropped. Thus,
q was not a truly persistent
goal after all, and so there
was no intention.
However, with El(BEL x q (p 1 q)) as the initial condition, q can no longer be dropped, and so our formalism

2. Under some circumstances,
an intention to achieve p is
sufficient for the agent to believe that p will eventually
be true.
The problem is when the intention
p is of the form Oq. By
the second principle,
in some cases, the agent will believe
that eventually
Oq will be true.
But OOq
is equivalent
to Oq, and so, by the first principle,
the belief allows the
intention
to be given up. But if the agent gives it up, Oq
need not be achieved after all!
Our theory of intention
based on P-GOAL avoids this
problem because an agent’s having a P-GOAL requires that
the goal be true later and that the agent not believe it
is currently
true. In particular,
an agent never forms the
intention to achieve anything like Oq: because (LATER Oq)
is always false, so is (P-GOAL
x Oq).
Finally, our analysis supports the observation
that intentions can (loosely speaking)
be viewed as the contents
of plans (e.g., [Bratman,
1986, Cohen and Perrault,
1979,
Pollack, 19861). Although we have not given a formal analysis of plans here (see [Pollack, 19861 for such an analysis),
the commitments
one undertakes
with respect to an action in a plan depend on the other planned actions, as well
as the pre- and post-conditions

actions..’ If x adopts a persistent
goal p relative to (GOAL

conditions
for x’s dropping her goal
include her believing
that she no longer has q as a goal.

agent’s dropping a supergoal is now a necessary

prerequisite
for her dropping a subgoal.
Thus,
with the change to relativized
persistent
goals, we open up
the possibility
of having a complex web of interdependenties among the agent’s goals, intentions,
and beliefs.

Conclusiom

Autonomous
agents need to be able to reason not only
about the plans that other agents have, but also about
their state of commitment
to those plans.
If one agent
finds out that another has failed in attempting
to achieve
something,
the first should be able to predict when the
other will try again. The first agent should be able to reason about the other agent’s intentions
and commitments
rather than be required to simulate the other agent’s planning and replanning
procedures.
This research has developed a formal theory of inten*tion that shows the intimate
relationship
of intention
to
commitment.
Whereas other logics have related belief and
knowledge to action, we have explored the consequences
of
adding another modality for goals, and have examined the
effects of keeping goals over time. The logic of intention derives from this logic of persistent
goal, and is finer-grained
than one might expect from our use of a possible-worlds
foundation.
It provides a descriptive
foundation
for reasoning about the intentions
of other agents, without
yet
making a commitment
to a reasoning strategy.
Finally, it
serves as the foundation
for a theory of speech acts and
communication
