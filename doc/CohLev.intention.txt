ABSTRACT

This paper explores principles governing the rational balance among an agent's beliefs, goals,
actions, and intentions. Such principles provide specifications for artificial agents, and approximate a
theory of human action (as philosophers use the term). By making explicit the conditions under
which an agent can drop his goals, i.e., by specifying how the agent is committed to his goals, the
formalism captures a number of important properties of intention. Specifically, the formalism
provides analyses for Bratman's three characteristicfunctional roles played by intentions [7, 9], and
shows how agents can avoid intending all the foreseen side-effects of what they actually intend.
Finally, the analysis shows how intentions can be adopted relative to a background of relevant beliefs
and other intentions or goals. By relativizing one agent's intentions in terms of beliefs about another
agent's intentions (or beliefs'), we derive a preliminary account of interpersonal commitments.

household robot. 1 You say "Willie, bring me a beer." The robot replies " O K ,
boss." Twenty minutes later, you screech "Willie, why didn't you bring that
beer?" It answers "Well, ! intended to get you the beer, but I decided to do
something else." Miffed, you send the wise guy back to the manufacturer,
complaining about a lack of commitment. After retrofitting, Willie is returned,
marked "Model C: The Committed Assistant." Again, you ask Willie to bring
a beer. Again, it accedes, replying "Sure thing." Then you ask: "What kind
did you buy?" It answers: " G e n e s s e e . " You say "Never mind." One minute
later, Willie trundles over with a Genessee in its gripper. This time, you angrily
return Willie for overcommitment. After still more tinkering, the manufacturer
sends Willie back, promising no more problems with its commitments. So,
being a somewhat trusting consumer, you accept the rascal back into your
household, but as a test, you ask it to bring you your last beer. Willie again
accedes, saying "Yes, Sir." (!ts attitude problem seems to have been fixed.)
The robot gets the beer and starts towards you. As it approaches, it lifts its
arm, wheels around, deliberately smashes the bottle, and trundles off. Back at
the plant, when interrogated by customer service as to why it had abandoned
its commitments, the robot replies that according to its specifications, it kept its
commitments as long as required---commitments must be dropped when
fulfilled or impossible to achieve. By smashing the last bottle, the commitment
became unachievable.
Despite the impeccable logic, and the correct implementation, Willie is
dismantled.
1.1. Rational balance

This paper is concerned with specifying the "rational balance ''2 needed among
the beliefs, goals, plans, intentions, commitments, and actions of autonomous
agents. Our specific objective is to explore the relationship that intention plays
in maintaining this balance. For example, the following are desirable properties
of intention: An autonomous agent should act on its intentions, not in spite of
them; adopt intentions it believes are feasible and forego those believed to be
infeasible; keep (or commit to) intentions, but not forever; discharge those
intentions believed to have been satisfied; alter intentions when relevant beliefs
change; and adopt subsidiary intentions during plan formation. From this list
one can see that an agent's adopting an intention has many effects on its
mental state. To specify what it means for an agent to have an intention, one
needs to describe how that intention affects the agent's web of beliefs,
commitments to future actions, and other interdependent intentions.
Because autonomous agents will have to exist in o u r world, making commitments to us and obeying our orders, a good place to begin a normative study of
This problematic robot is very loosely based on Willie, the robot in Philip K. Dick's novel, The
Galactic Pot-Healer.

rational balance is to examine various commonsense relationships among
human beliefs, intentions, and commitments that seem to justify our attribution of the term "rational." However, our goals in this study extend to the
characterization of interaction and communication. We propose a logic suitable
both for describing and reasoning about agent's mental states as well as agents'
abilities to affect the mental states of others. Not only will a theorist have to
reason about the kinds of interactions agents can have, in order to communicate, agents themselves need to reason about the beliefs, intentions, and
commitments of other agents. Although we do not consider communication
here, our analysis serves as a foundation for a theory of speech acts [13, 14],
and applies more generally to situations in which communication may take
place in an artificial language.
In its emphasis on formally specifying constraints on the design of autonomous agents, this paper is intended to contribute to artificial intelligence
research. To the extent that our analysis captures the ordinary concept of
intention, this paper may contribute to the philosophy of mind. We discuss
both areas below.
1.2. Artificial intelligence research on planning systems
AI research has concentrated on algorithms for finding plans to achieve given
goals, on monitoring plan execution, and on replanning [18]. Recently, planning in dynamic, multiagent domains has become a topic of interest, especially
the planning of communication acts needed for one agent to affect the mental
state and behavior of another [1, 3, 4, 12, 13, 15, 19, 21, 29, 43, 44]. Typically,
this research has ignored the issues of rational balance---of precisely how an
agent's beliefs, goals, and intentions should be related to its actions. 3 In such
systems, the theory of intentional action embodied by the agent is expressed
only as code, with the relationships among the agent's beliefs, goals, plans, and
actions left implicit in the agent's architecture. If asked, the designer of a
planning system may say that the notion of intention is defined operationally:
A planning system's intentions are no more than the contents of its plans. As
such, intentions are representations of possible actions the system may take to
achieve its goal(s). This way of operationalizing the concept of intention has a
number of difficulties. First, although there surely is a strong relationship
between plans and intentions [41], agents may form plans that they never
"adopt," and thus the notion of a plan lacks the characteristic commitment to
action inherent in our commonsense understanding of intention. Second, even
if we accept the claim that a planning system's intentions are the contents of its
plans, what constitutes a plan for most planning systems is itself often a murky
3Exceptions include the work of Moore [36] who analyzed the relationship of knowledge to
action, and that of Appelt [4], Haas [23], Konolige [27, 28] and Morgenstern [37]. However, none
of these works address the issue of goals and intention.

216

topic. 4 Thus, saying that the system's intentions are the contents of its plans
lacks needed precision. Finally, operational definitions are usually quite difficult to reason with and about. If the program changes, then so may the
definitions, in which case there would not be a fixed set of specifications that
the program implements. Communication involves one's ability to reason
about the intentions of others [22, 39], With only an operational definition
rather than a declarative characterization of rational balance, it becomes quite
difficult to engage in such reasoning. This paper can be seen as providing both
a logic in which to write specifications for autonomous agents, and an initial
theory cast in that logic.

1.3. Philosophical theories of intention
Philosophers have long been concerned with the concept of intention, often
trying to reduce it to some combination of belief and desire. We shall explore
their territory here, but cannot possibly do justice to the immense body of
literature on the subject. Our strategy is to make connection with some of the
more recent work, and hope our efforts are not yet another failed attempt,
amply documented in The Big Book of Classical Mistakes.
Philosophers have drawn a distinction between future-directed intentions
and present-directed ones [8, 9, 47]. The former guide agents' planning and
constrain their adoption of other intentions [9], whereas the latter function
causally in producing behavior [47]. For example, one's future-directed intentions may include cooking dinner tomorrow, and one's present-directed intentions may include moving an arm now. Most philosophical analysis has
examined the relationship between an agent's doing something intentionally
and that agent's having a present-directed intention. Recently, Bratman [8] has
argued that intending to do something (or having an intention) and doing
something intentionally are not the same p h e n o m e n o n , and that the former is
more concerned with the coordination of an agent's plans. We agree, and in
this paper we concentrate primarily on future-directed intentions. Hereafter,
the term "intention" will be used in that sense only.
Intention has often been analyzed differently from other mental states such
as belief and knowledge. First, whereas the content of beliefs and knowledge is
usually considered to be in the form of propositions, the content of an
intention is typically regarded as an action. For example, Castefiada [10] treats
the content of an intention as a "practition," similar to an action description
(in computer science terms). It is claimed that by doing so, and by strictly
separating the logic of propositions from the logic of practitions, one avoids
undesirable properties in the logic of intention, such as the fact that if one
intends to do an action a one must also intend to do a or b. Howevcr, it has
4Rosenschein [45] identifies some of the semantic weakncsses in the A1 literature's treatment of
hierarchically specified plans, and presents a formal theory of plans in terms of dynamic logic.

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

217

also been argued that needed connections between propositions and practitions
may not be derivable [7].
Searle [47] claims that the content of an intention is a causally self-referential
representation of its conditions of satisfaction (and see also [26]). That is, for
an agent to intend to go to the store, the conditions of satisfaction would be
that the intention should cause the agent to go to the store. Our analysis is
incomplete in that it does not deal with this causal self-reference. Nevertheless,
the present analysis will characterize many important properties of intention
discussed in the philosophical literature.
A second difference among kinds of propositional attitudes is that some,
such as belief, can be analyzed in isolation--one axiomatizes the properties of
belief apart from those of other attitudes. However, intention is intimately
connected with other attitudes, especially belief, as well as with time and
action. Thus, any formal analysis of intention must explicate these relationships. In the next sections, we explore what it is that theories of intention
should handle.
1.4. Desiderata for a theory of intention

Bratman [9] argues that rational behavior cannot just be analyzed in terms of
beliefs and desires (as many philosophers have held). A third mental state,
intention, which is related in many interesting ways to beliefs and desires but is
not reducible to them, is necessary. There are two justifications for this claim.
First, noting that agents are resource-bounded, Bratman suggests that no agent
can continually weigh his 5 competing desires, and concomitant beliefs, in
deciding what to do next. At some point, the agent must just settle on one state
of affairs for which to aim. Deciding what to do establishes a limited form of
commitment. We shall explore the consequences of such commitments.
A second reason is the need to coordinate one's future actions. Once a
future act is settled on, that is, intended, one typically decides on other future
actions to take with that action as given. This ability to plan to do some act A
in the future, and to base decisions on what to do subsequent to A, requires
that a rational agent not simultaneously believe he will not do A. If he did, the
rational agent would not be able to plan past A since he believes it will not be
done. Without some notion of commitment, deciding what else to do would be
a hopeless task.
Bratman argues that unlike mere desires, intentions play the following three
functional roles:
(1) Intentions normally pose problems f o r the agent; the agent needs to
determine a way to achieve them. For example, if an agent in California intends
to fly to New York on a certain date, he should be motivated to find his way to
SOr her: we use the masculine version here throughout.

218

P.R. C O H E N A N D H.J. L E V E S Q U E

New York. That is, the agent should form a plan of action to go to New York,
and then (all else being equal) to do something in order to get there. If the
agent takes no actions to enable him to do so, then the intention did not affect
the agent in the right way.
(2) Intentions provide a "screen of admissibility" for adopting other intentions. Whereas desires can be inconsistent, agents do not normally adopt
intentions that they believe conflict with their present- and future-directed
intentions. For example, if an agent intends to hardboil an egg, and knows he
has only one egg (and cannot get any more in time), he should not simultaneously intend to make an omelette.
(3) Agents "track" the success of their attempts to achieve their intentions.
Not only do agents care whether their attempts succeed, but they are disposed
to replan to achieve the intended effects if earlier attempts fail.
In addition to the above functional roles, it has been argued that intending
should satisfy the following properties. If an agent intends to achieve p, then:
(4) The agent believes p is possible.
(5) The agent does not believe he will not bring about p.6
(6) Under certain conditions, the agent believes he will bring about p.
(7) Agents need not intend all the expected side-effects of their intentions]
For example, imagine a situation not too long ago in which an agent has a
toothache. Although dreading the process, the agent decides that he needs
desperately to get his tooth filled. Being uninformed about anaesthetics, the
agent believes that the process of having his tooth filled will necessarily cause
him much pain. Although the agent intends to ask the dentist to fill his tooth,
and, believing what he does, he is willing to put up with pain, the agent could
surely deny that he thereby intends to be in pain.
Bratman argues that what one intends is, loosely speaking, a subset of what
one chooses. Consider an agent as choosing one desire to pursue from among
his competing desires, and in so doing, choosing to achieve some state of
affairs. If the agent believes his action(s) will have certain effects, the agent has
chosen those effects as well. That is, one chooses a "scenario" or a possible
world. However, one does not intend everything in that scenario, for example,
one need not intend harmful expected side-effects of one's actions (though if
one knowingly brings them about as a consequence of one's intended action,
they have been brought about intentionally.) Bratman argues that side-effects
do not play the same roles in the agent's planning as true intentions do. In
particular, they are not goals whose achievement the agent will track; if the
agent does not achieve them, he will not go back and try again.
6The rationale for this property was discussed above.
7 Many theories of intention are committed to the undesirable view that expected side-effects to
one's intentions are intended as well.

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

219

We will develop a theory in which expected side-effects are chosen, but not
intended. These properties are our primary desiderata for a treatment of
intention. However, motivated by AI research, we add one other, as described
below:
1.5. The "Little Nell" problem: Not giving up too soon

McDermott [35] points out the following difficulty with a naively designed
planning system:
Say a problem solver is confronted with the classic situation of a
heroine, called Nell, having been tied to the tracks while a train
approaches. The problem solver, called Dudley, knows that "If
Nell is going to be mashed, I must remove her from the tracks."
(He probably knows a more general rule, but let that pass.) When
Dudley deduces that he must do something, he looks for, and
eventually executes, a plan for doing it. This will involve finding out
where Nell is, and making a navigation plan to get to her location.
Assume that he knows where she is, and he is not too far away;
then the fact that the plan will be carried out will be added to
Dudley's world model. Dudley must have some kind of data-baseconsistency maintainer (Doyle, 1979) to make sure that the plan is
deleted if it is no longer necessary. Unfortunately, as soon as an
apparently successful plan is added to the world model, the consistency maintainer will notice that "Nell is going to be mashed" is
no longer true. But that removes any justification for the plan, so it
goes too. But that means "Nell is going to be mashed" is no longer
contradictory, so it comes back in. And so forth. (p.102)
The agent continually plans to save Nell, and abandons its plan because it
believes it will be successful. M c D e r m o t t attributes the problem to the inability
of various planning systems to express "Nell is going to be mashed unless I save
her," and to reason about the concept of prevention. Haas [23] blames the
problem on a failure to distinguish between actual and possible events. The
planner should be trying to save Nell based on a belief that it is possible that
she will be mashed, rather than on the belief that she in fact will be mashed.
Although reasoning about prevention, expressing "unless," and distinguishing
between possible and actual events are important aspects of the original
formulation of the problem, the essence of the Little Nell problem is the more
general problem of an agent's giving up an intention too soon. We shall show
how to avoid it.
As should be clear from the previous discussion, much rides on an analysis of
intention and commitment. In the next section, we indicate how these concepts
can be approximated.

220

1.6. Intention as a composite concept
Intention will be modeled as a composite concept specifying what the agent has
chosen and how the agent is committed to that choice. First, consider the
desire that the agent has chosen to pursue as put into a new category. Call this
chosen desire, loosely, a goal. s By construction, chosen desires are consistent.
We will give them a possible worlds semantics, and hence the agent will have
chosen a set of worlds in which the goal/desire holds.
Next, consider an agent to have a persistent goal if he has a goal (i.e., a
chosen set of possible worlds) that will be kept at least as long as certain
conditions hold. For example, for a fanatic these conditions might be that his
goal has not been achieved but is still achievable. If either of those circumstances fail, even the fanatical agent must drop his c o m m i t m e n t to achieving
the goal. Persistence involves an agent's internal c o m m i t m e n t to a course of
events over time. 9 Although a persistent goal is a composite concept, it models
a distinctive state of mind in which agents have both chosen and committed to
a state of affairs.
We will model intention as a kind of persistent goal. This concept, and
especially its variations allowing for subgoals, interpersonal subgoals, and
commitments relative to certain other conditions, is interesting for its ability to
model much of B r a t m a n ' s analysis. For example, the analysis shows that agents
need not intend the expected side-effects of their intentions because agents
need not be committed to the expected consequences of those intentions. To
preview the analysis, persistence need not hold for expected side-effects
because the agent's beliefs about the linkage of the act and those effects could
change.
Strictly speaking, the formalism predicts that agents only intend the logical
equivalences of their intentions, and in some cases intend their logical consequences. Thus, even using a possible-worlds approach, one can get a modal
operator that satisfies many desirable properties of a model of intention.
2. Methodology
2.1. Strategy: A tiered formalism
The formalism will be developed in two layers: atomic and molecular. The
foundational atomic layer provides the primitives for the theory of rational
action. At this level can be found the analysis of beliefs, goals, and actions.
Most of the work here is to sort out the relationships among the basic modal
operators. Although the primitives chosen are motivated by the p h e n o m e n a to
Such desires are ones that speech act theorists claim to be conveyed by illocutionary acts such
as requests.
9This is not a social commitment. It remains to be seen if the latter can be built out of the
former.

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

221

be explained, few commitments are made at this level to details of theories of
rational action. In fact, many theories could be developed with the same set of
primitive concepts. Thus, at the foundational level, we provide a framework in
which to express such theories.
The second layer provides new concepts defined out of the primitives. Upon
these concepts, we develop a partial theory of rational action. Defined
concepts provide economy of expression, and may themselves be of theoretical
significance because the theorist has chosen to form some definitions and not
others. The use of defined concepts elucidates the origin of their important
properties. For example, in modeling intention with persistent goals, one can
see how various properties depend on particular primitive concepts.
Finally, although we do not do so in this paper (but see [14]), one can erect
theories of rational interaction and communication on this foundation. By
doing so, properties of communicative acts can be derived from the embedding
logic of rational interaction, whose properties are themselves grounded in
rational action.
2.2. Successive approximations
The approach to be followed in this paper is to approximate the needed
concepts with sufficient precision to enable us to explore their interactions. We
do not take as our goal the development of an exceptionless theory, but rather
will be content to give plausible analyses that cover the important and frequent
cases. Marginal cases (and arguments based on them) will be ignored when
developing the first version of the theory.
2.3. Idealizations
The research presented here is founded on various idealizations of rational
behavior. Just as initial progress in the study of mechanics was made by
assuming frictionless planes, so too can progress be made in the study of
rational action with the right idealizations. Such assumptions should approximate reality--for example, beliefs can be wrong and revised, goals not
achieved and d r o p p e d - - b u t not so closely as to overwhelm. Ultimately,
choosing the right initial idealizations is a matter of research strategy and taste.
A key idealization we make is that no agent will attempt to achieve
something forever---everyone has limited persistence. Similarly, agents will be
assumed not to procrastinate forever. Although agents may adopt commitments that can only be given when certain conditions, C, hold, the assumption
of limited persistence requires that the agent eventually drop each commitment. Hence, it can be concluded that eventually conditions C hold. Only
because of this assumption are we able to draw conclusions from an agent's
adopting a persistent goal. Our strategy will be first to explore the consequences of fanatical persistence--commitment to a goal until it is believed to

L~This is unlike the integration of similar operators by Moore [36], who analyzes how an agent's
knowledge affects and is affected by his actions. That research meshed a possible-worlds model of
knowledge with a situation-calculus-style, branching-time model of action [34]. Our earlier work
[13] used a similar branching-time dynamic-logic model. However, the model's inability to support
beliefs about what was in fact about to happen in the future led to many difficulties.
~ For this paper, the only events that will be considered are those performed by an agent. These
events may be thought of as event types, in that they do not specify the time of occurrence, but do
include all the other arguments. Thus John's hitting Mary would be such an event type.

attempts to develop finer-grained semantics (e.g., [6, 16]). Second, the formalism will describe agents as satisfying certain properties that might generally be
true, but for which there might be exceptions. Perhaps a process of nonmonotonic reasoning could smooth over the exceptions, but we will not
attempt to specify such reasoning here (but see [38]). Instead, we assemble a
set of basic principles and examine their consequences for rational interaction.
Finally, the formalism should be regarded as a description or specification of an
agent, rather than one that any agent could or should use.
Most of the advantage of the formalism stems from the assumption that
agents have a limited tolerance for frustration; they will not work forever to
achieve their goals. Yet, because agents are (often) persistent in achieving their
goals, they will work to achieve them. Hence, although all goals will be
dropped, they will not be dropped too soon.

3.1. Syntax
For simplicity, we adopt a logic with no singular terms, using instead predicates
and existential quantifiers. However, for readability, we will often use constants. The interested reader can expand these out into the full predicative
form if desired.

Time propositions are currently just numerals. However, for ease of exposition, we shall write them as if they were time-date expressions such as
2:30PM/3/6/85. These will be true or false in a course of events at a given index
iff the index is the same as that denoted by the time proposition (i.e.,
numeral). Depending on the problem at hand, we may use timeless propositions, such as (At Robot NÂ¥). O t h e r problems are more accurately modeled by
conjoining a time proposition, such as (At Robot NY) A 2.30PM/3/6/85. Thus, if
the above conjunction were a goal, both conjuncts would have to be true
simultaneously.

3.2. Semantics

We shall adapt the usual possible-worlds model for belief to deal with goals.
Assume there is a set of possible worlds T, each one consisting of a sequence
(or course) or events, temporally extended infinitely in past and future. Each
possible world characterizes possible ways the world could have been, and
could be. Thus, each world specifies what happens in the future. Agents
usually do not know precisely which world they are in. Instead, some of the
worlds in T are consistent with the agents beliefs, and some with his goals,
where the consistency is specified in the usual way, by means of an accessibility
relation on tuples of worlds, agents, and an index, n, into the course of events
defining the world (from which one can compute a time point, if need be).
To consider what an agent believes (or has as a goal), one needs to supply a
world and an index into the course of events defining that world. As the world
evolves, agents' beliefs and goals change. When an agent does an action in
some world, he does not bring about a new world, though he can alter the facts
of that world at that time. Instead, after an event has happened, we shall say
the world is in a new " s t a t e " in which new facts hold and the set of accessible
worlds has been altered. That is, the agent changes the way he thinks the world
could be a n d / o r chooses the world to be.

3.2.1. Model theory
A m o d e l M is a structure ( (9, P, E, Agt, T, B, G, ~ ) , w h e r e (9 is a set, P is a
set of people, E is a set of primitive event types, A g t E [E---> P] specifies the
agent of an event, T C_ [7/---~ E] is a set of possible courses of events (or worlds)
specified as a function f r o m the integers to elements of E, B C_ T x P x 7 / x T
is the belief accessibility relation, G C_ T x P x 7 / x T is the goal accessibility
relation, and @ interprets predicates. F o r m u l a s will be evaluated with respect
to s o m e possible course of events, hereafter some possible worM, and an
" i n d e x " into that possible world, that is, at a particular point in the course of
events.J2
3.2.2. Definitions
(1) D = (9 U P U E*, specifying the d o m a i n of quantification. T h a t is, one
can quantify over things, people, and sequences of (types of) primitive
events. Given this, q~ C_ [Pred k x T x 7/x Dk].
(2) AGTC_ E* x P, w h e r e x E AGT[e I . . . . . e,] iff there is an i such that
x = Agt(ei). T h a t is, A G T specifies the partial agents of a sequence of
events.
3.2.3. Satisfaction
A s s u m e M is a m o d e l , c r a s e q u e n c e of events, n an integer, v a set of bindings
of variables to objects in D, and if v E [Vars--~ D], then v] is that function
which yields d for x and is the same as v e v e r y w h e r e else. We now specify what
it means for M,o-,v,n to satisfy a wff o~, which we write as M,o-,v,n ~ ~.
Because of formulas involving actions, this definition d e p e n d s on what it m e a n s
for an expression a to occur b e t w e e n index points n and m. This, we write as
M,o',v,n~a~m, and is itself defined in terms of satisfaction. T h e definitions are
as follows:
(1) m,o-,v,n ~ P(x 1. . . . . xk) iff ( v ( x l ) . . . v(xk) ) @ 0O[p, ~, n]. Notice that
the interpretation of predicates d e p e n d s on the world or and the event
index n.
(2) M,o-,v,n ~ --nc~ iff M, cr,v,n ~ a.
(3) M,cr, v,n ~ (c~ v / 3 ) iff M,o',v,n ~ c~ or M,o-,v,n ~ 13.
(4) M,o-,v,n ~ : l x a iff M,cr, v~,n ~ o~ for some d in D.
(5) M,o-,v,n ~ (x, = x2) iff v(x,) = v(x2).
(6) M,o-,v,n ~ ( T i m e - p r o p o s i t i o n ) iff v ( ( T i m e - p r o p o s i t i o n ) ) = n.
Next, we treat events and actions, describing what it m e a n s for an action to
be a b o u t to occur, and to have just occurred:
~ZFor those readers accustomed to specifying possible worlds as real-numbered times and events
as denoting intervals over them (e.g., [2]), we remark that we shall not be concerned in this paper
about parallel execution of events over the same time interval. Hence, we model possible worlds as
courses (i.e., sequences) of events.

3.2.4. Abbreviations
It will be convenient to adopt the following:
E m p t y sequence: nil~f(Vx (x = x))? and a = NIL~fVb (a ~<b ) .
As a test action, NIL always succeeds; as an event sequence, it is a
subsequence of every other one.
def
- Conditional action: [IF a THEN a ELSE b] = a ? ; a ~ a ? ; b .
That is, as in dynamic logic, an if-then-else action is a disjunctive action of
doing action a at a time at which a is true or doing action b at a time at
which a is false. Note that the semantics of a conditional action does not
require that the condition be believed by someone to be true. H o w e v e r as
will be discussed later, when agents execute conditionals with disjoint
branches, they will have to believe the condition is true (or believe it is
false).
- W h i l e - l o o p s : [WHILE ol DOa] = (c~?;a) ; ~ a ?
While-loops are a sequence of doing action a zero or more times, prior to
each of which a is true. After the iterated action stops, c~ is false.
- Eventually: ~ def3x (HAPPENS x ; a ? ) .
In other words, ~ct is true (in a given possible world) if there is some
sequence of events after which a will hold, that is, if a is true at some point
in the future.
def
- Always: []a = - l ~ a .
[ ] ~ means that a is henceforth true in the course of events. A useful
application of [] is â¢ ( p D q ) , in which no matter what happens, P still
implies q. We can now distinguish between p D q's being logically valid, its
being true in all courses of events, and its merely being true after some
event happens.
-

3.2.5. Constraints on the m o d e l
(1) Consistency: B is Euclidean, transitive and serial, G is serial. B's being
Euclidean essentially means that the worlds the agent thinks are possible
(given what is believed) form an equivalence relation but do not necessarily
include the real world [24]. Seriality implies that beliefs and goals are (separately) consistent. This is enforced by there always being a world that is either
B- or G-related to a given world.
(2) Realism: Vcr, tr*, if (~r, n ) G [ p ] o r * , then (o-, n ) B [ p ] o ' * . In other words,
G C_ B. That is, the worlds that are consistent with what the agent has chosen
are not ruled out by his beliefs. Without this constraint, the agent could choose
worlds involving (for example) future events that he believes will never
happen. We believe this condition to be so strong, and its model theoretical
statement so simple, that it deserves to be imposed as a constraint. It ensures
that an agent does not want the opposite of what he believes to be unchangeable. For example, assume an agent knows that he will die in two months (and

228

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

he does not believe in life after death). One would not expect that agent, if still
rational, to buy a plane ticket for himself to go to Miami in order to play golf
three months hence. Simply, an agent cannot choose such worlds since they are
not compatible with what he believes.

3.3. Properties of the model
We begin by exploring the temporal and action-related aspects of the model,
describing properties of our modal operators HAPPENS, DONE, and ~ . Next,
we discuss belief and relate it to the temporal modalities. Then, we explore the
relationships among all these and GOAL. Finally, we characterize an agent's
persistence in achieving a goal.
Valid properties of the model are termed "Propositions." Properties that
constitute our theory of the interrelationships among agent's beliefs, goals, and
actions will be stated as "Assumptions." These are essentially nonlogical
axioms that constrain the models that we consider.
3.3.1. Events and action expressions
The framework proposed here separates primitive events from action expressions. Examples of primitive events might include moving an arm, grasping,
exerting force, and uttering a word or sentence. Action expressions denote
sequences of primitive events that satisfy certain properties. For example, a
movement of a finger may result in a circuit being closed, which may result in a
light coming on. We will say that one primitive event happened, but one which
can be characterized by various complex action expressions. This distinction
between primitive events and complex action descriptions must be kept in mind
when characterizing real world phenomena or natural language expressions.
For example, to say that an action a occurs, we use (HAPPENS a). To
characterize world states that are brought about, we use (HAPPENS ~p?;a;p?),
saying that event a brings about p. To be a bit more concrete, one would not
typically have a primitive event type for closing a circuit. So, to say that John
closed the circuit one would say that John did something (perhaps a sequence
of primitive events) causing the circuit to be c i o s e d - - 3 e (DONE

q (Closed c)?;e;(Closed c)?).
Another way to characterize actions and events is to have predicates be true
of them. For example, one could have (Walk e) to say that a given event (type)
is a walking event. This way of describing events has the advantage of allowing
complex properties (such as running a race) to hold for an undetermined (and
unnamed) sequence of events. However, because the predications are made
about the events, not the attendant circumstances, this method does not allow
us to describe events performed only in certain circumstances. We will need to
use both methods for describing actions.

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

229

3.3.2. Properties of acts~events under HAPPENS
We adopt the usual axioms characterizing how complex action expressions
behave under HAPPENS, as treated in a dynamic logic (e.g., [25, 36,42]),
including the following:

Proposition 3.1. Properties of complex acts:
(HAPPENS a;b) ~ (HAPPENS a;(HAPPENS b)?),
(HAPPENS alb) --- (HAPPENS a) v (HAPPENS b),
(HAPPENS p?;q?) --=p/x q,
(HAPPENS a*;b) ------(HAPPENS bla;a*;b).
That is, action a;b happens next iff a happens next producing a world state in
which b then happens next. The "nondeterministic choice" action alb (read "]"
as " o r " ) happens next iff a happens next or b does. The test action p? happens
next iff p is currently true. Finally, the iterative action a*;b happens next iff b
happens or one step of the iteration has been taken followed by the a*;b again.
Among many additional properties, note that after doing action a, a would
have just been done:

Proposition 3.2. ~ (HAPPENS a) --=(HAPPENS a;(DONE a)?)
Also, if a has just been done, then just prior to its occurrence, it was going
to happen next.

Proposition 3.3. ~ (DONE a) --= (DONE (HAPPENS a)?;a)
Although this may seem to say that the unfolding of the world is determined
only by what has just happened, and is not random, this determinacy is entirely
moot for our purposes. Agents need never know what possible world they are
in and hence what will happen next. More serious would be a claim that agents
have no "free will"--what happens next is determined without regard to their
intentions. However, as we shall see, this is not a property of agents; their
intentions constrain their future actions. Next, observe that a test action is
done whenever the condition holds:

Proposition 3.4. ~ p --=(DONE p?)
That is, the test action filters out courses of events in which the proposition
tested is false. The truth of Proposition 3.4 follows immediately from the
definition of " ? " .
For convenience, let us define versions of DONE and HAPPENS that specify
the agent of the act.

230

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

Definition 3.5. (DONE x a)~'(DONE a) A (AGT x a)
Definition 3.6. (HAPPENS x a) aef(HAPPENS a) A (AGT x a).
Finally, one distinction is worth pointing out. When action variables are
bound by quantifiers, they range over sequences of events (more precisely,
event types). When they are left free in a formula, they are intended as
schematic and can be instantiated with complex action expressions.
3.3.3. Temporal modalities: DONE, ~ , and []
Temporal concepts are introduced with DONE (for past happenings) and O
(read "eventually"). To say that p was true at some point in the past, we use
3e (DONE p?;e). ~ is to be regarded in the "linear-time" sense and is defined
above. Essentially, Op is true iff somewhere in the future, p becomes true. Op
and O q p are jointly satisfiable. Since Op starts " n o w , " the following property
is also true,

Proposition 3.7. ~ p 53 Op.
The following are also trivial consequences:

Proposition 3.8. ~ O(p v q) A Dqq 53 Op,
Proposition 3.9. ~ rq(p ~ q) A Op ~ Oq.
To talk about propositions that are not true now, but will become true, we
define:

Definition 3.10. (LATER p ) ~ f q p A Op.
A property of this definition that follows from the equivalence Op and O O p
is:

Proposition 3.11. ~ 7(LATER Op).
3.3.4. Constraining courses of events
We will have occasion to state constraints on courses of events. To do so, we
define the following:

Definition 3.12.
(BEFORE p q) def
= Vc (HAPPENS c;q?) ~ 3a (a <~c) A (HAPPENS a;p?)
This definition states that p comes before q (starting at index n in the course
of events) if, whenever q is true in a course of events, p has been true (after the

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

231

index n). Obviously,

Proposition 3.13. ~ Oq A (BEFORE p q) 3 ~p.
That is, if q is eventually true, and q's being true requires that p has been
true, then eventually p holds. Furthermore, we have

Proposition 3.14. ~ 7 p 3 (BEFORE ( 3 e (DONE 7p?;e;p?)) p).
This basically says that worlds are consistent--no proposition changes truthvalue without some event happening. In particular, there is no notion in this
model for the simple passage of time (without any intervening events) affecting
anyone's beliefs or goals. One would like to adopt the view that some event
must cause that change, but as yet, there is no primitive relation of causality.

3.4. The attitudes
BEL and GOAL characterize what is implicit in an agent's beliefs and goals
(chosen desires), rather than what an agent actively or explicitly believes, or
has as a goal. 13 That is, these operators characterize what the world would be
like if the agent's beliefs and goals were true. Importantly, we do not include
an operator for wanting, since desires need not be consistent. Although desires
certainly play an important role in determining goals and intentions, we assume
that once an agent has sorted out his possibly inconsistent desires in deciding
what he wishes to achieve, the worlds he will be striving for are consistent.

3.5. Belief
For simplicity, we assume the usual Hintikka-style axiom schemata for BEL [24]
(corresponding to a "Weak $5" modal logic).

Proposition 3.15. Belief axioms:
Vx(BELx p) A (BELx (p ] q)) ] (BELxq),
Vx (BEL x p) 3 (BEL x (BEL x p)),
Vx 7(gEL x p) ] (BEL x-7(BEL x p)),
Vx (BEE x p) ] 7(BEL x 7 p ) .
And, we have the usual "necessitation" rule:

Proposition 3.16. If ~ a, then ~ (BELx a).
If a is a theorem (i.e., is valid), then it follows from the agent's beliefs at all
times. For example, all tautologies follow from the agent's beliefs. Clearly, we
also have:
13For an exploration of the issues involved in explicit versus implicit belief, see [33].

232

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

Proposition 3.17. If ~ a, then ~ (BELx D e ) .
That is, theorems are believed to be always true. Also, we introduce KNOW
by definition:

Definition 3.18. (KNOW x p) ~fp A (BEL x p).
Of course, this characterization of knowledge has many known difficulties,
but will suffice for present purposes. Next, we will say an agent is COMPETENT
with respect to p if he is correct whenever he thinks p is true.

Definition 3.19. (COMPETENTx p)def(BEL x p) 53(KNOW x p).
Agents competent with respect to some proposition p adopt only beliefs
about that proposition for which they have good evidence. For the purposes of
this paper, we assume that agents are competent with respect to the primitive
actions they have done:

Assumption 3.20. ~=Vx,e (AGT x e) 53 [(DONE e) --=(BEL x (DONE e))].
Note that this assumption does not hold when e is replaced by an arbitrary
action expression, even if x is the agent. For example, if the agent does not
know the truth value of 13 after just doing a, the agent may have done the
action a;p? without realizing it was done. But the assumption rules out
unknowing execution of primitive actions by an agent. In Section 5.1, we will
make additional assumptions about the actions an agent is about to perform.

3.6. Goals
At a given point in a course of events, agents choose worlds they would like
(most) to be in---ones in which their goals are true. (GOAL x p) is meant to be
read as p is true in all worlds, accessible from the current world, that are
compatible with the agent's goals. Roughly, p follows from the agent's goals.
Since agents choose entire worlds, they choose the (logically and physically)
necessary consequences of their goals. At first glance, this appears troublesome
if we interpret the facts that are true in all worlds compatible with an agent's
goals as intended. However, intention will involve a form of commitment that
will rule out such consequences as being intended, although they are chosen.
GOAL has the following properties:

Proposition 3.21. Consistency: ~ Vx (GOALx p) 53 -q(GOALx ~p).
What is implicit in someone's goals is closed under consequence:

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

233

Proposition 3.22. ~ (GOAL x p) ^ (GOAL x (p D q)) D (GOAL x q).
Again, we have a necessitation property:

Proposition 3.23. If ~ a, then ~ (GOALx a).
That is, if a is a theorem, it is true in all chosen worlds. However, agents can
distinguish such "trivial" goals from others, as explained below.
3.6.1. Achievement goals
Agents can distinguish between achievement goals and maintenance goals.
Achievement goals are those the agent believes to be false; maintenance goals
are those the agent already believes to be true. We shall not be concerned in
this paper with maintenance goals. But, to characterize achievement goals, we
use:

Definition 3.24. (A-GOAL x p)~f(GOAL x (LATER p)) A (BEL x -Tp)
That is, x believes (and therefore accepts) that p is currently false, but in his
chosen worlds, p is eventually true. In other words, this is the more standard
notion of goal, where what is desired for the future is something that is
believed to be currently false.
3.6.2. No persistence~deferral forever
Agents are limited in both their persistence and their procrastination. They
cannot try forever to achieve their goals; eventually they give up. On the other
hand, agents do not forever defer working on their goals. The assumption
below captures both of these desiderata.

Assumption 3.25. ~ ~7(GOAL x (LATER p)).
Thus, agents eventually drop all achievement goals. Because one cannot
conclude that agents always act on their goals, one needs to guard against
infinite procrastination. However, one could have an agent who forever fails to
achieve his goals, but believes success is still achievable. The limiting case here
is an agent who executes an infinite loop. Another case is that of a compulsive
gambler who continually thinks success is just around the corner. Our assumption rules out these pathological cases from consideration, but still allows
agents to try hard. Finally, since no one ever said the world is fair (in the
computer science sense), an agent who is ready to act in what he believes to be
the correct circumstance may never get a chance to execute his action because
the world keeps changing. We only require that if faced with such monumental
unfairness, the agent reach the conclusion that the act is impossible.

234

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

One might object that there are still
keep forever. For example, one might
always want more m o n e y than I have" is
agent is alive); 14 but consider a plausible
in our formal language:

achievement goals that agents could
argue that the goal expressed by " I
kept forever (or at least as long as the
logical representation of that sentence

[][GOAL I =lx,y (HAVE Ix)/x (y > x)/x (LATER (HAVE I y))].
This sentence may be true, but it does not express an achievement goal since at
some points the existential may be believed to be true (and the goal is merely
to maintain that truth). To express the achievement aspect, it is necessary to
quantify into the GOAL clause as in

[][Vx (KNOW I (HAVE I x)) D (A-GOAL I 3y ((y > x)/x (HAVE I y))] â¢
But here, there is no single sentence that the agent always has as a goal; the
goal changes because of the quantified variables. Hence, one cannot argue he
keeps anything as an achievement goal forever. Instead, the agent forever gets
new achievement goals.
Important consequences will follow from Assumption 3.25 when combined
with an agent's commitments. First, we need to examine what, in general, are
the consequences of having goals.
3.6.3. Goals and their consequences
Unlike BEL, GOAL needs to be characterized in terms of all the other
modalities. In particular, we need to specify how goals interact with an agent's
beliefs about the future.
The semantics of GOAL specifies that worlds compatible with an agent's goals
must be included in those compatible with his beliefs. This is reflected in the
following property:

Proposition 3.26.

~ (BEL x p) D (GOALx p).

From the semantics of BEL and GOAL, one sees that p will be evaluated at
the same point in the B- and G-accessible worlds. So, if an agent believes p is
true now, he cannot now want it to be currently false; agents do not choose
what they cannot change. Conversely, if p is now true in all the agent's chosen
worlds, then the agent does not believe it is currently false. For example, if an
agent believes he has just done event e, then he cannot have (DONE x e) as a
goal. O f course, he can have (LATER (DONE x e)) as a goal.
This relationship between BEL and GOAL makes more sense when one
,4 However, we have assumed immortal agents.

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

considers the future. Let p be of the form Oq. From Proposition 3.26, we
derive that if the agent wants q to be true sometime in the future, he does not
believe it will be forever false. Conversely, let p be a proposition of the form
Dq. So, if an agent believes q is forever true (an example would be a
tautology), Proposition 3.26 says that any worlds that the agent chooses must
have q's being true as well.
Notice that although an agent may have to put up with what he believes is
inevitable, he may do so reluctantly, knowing that if he should change his mind
about the inevitability of that state of affairs, his choices would change. For
example, the following is satisfiable:

(BEL x <~p A N[-7(BEL x ~p) D (GOAL x D-Tp)]).
That is, the agent can believe p is inevitable (and hence in all the agent's
chosen worlds, 13will eventually be true), but at the same time believe that if he
ever stops believing it is inevitable, he will choose worlds in which it is never
true.
Notice also that, as a corollary of Proposition 3.26, agent's beliefs and goals
"line up" with respect to their own primitive actions that happen next.

Proposition 3.27.
Vx,e (BEL x (HAPPENS x e)) D (GOAL x (HAPPENS x e)).
That is, if an agent believes he is about to do something next, then its
happening next is true in all his chosen worlds. Of course, "successful" agents
are ones who choose what they are going to do before believing they are going
to do it; they come to believe they are going to do something because they
have made certain choices. We discuss this further in our treatment of
intention.
Next, as another simple subcase, consider the consequences of facts the agent
believes hold in all of that agent's chosen worlds.

Proposition 3.28. Expected consequences:
(GOAL x p) A (BEL x (p D q)) D (GOAL x q).
By Proposition 3.26, if an agent believes p D q is true, p D q is true in all his
chosen worlds. Hence by Proposition 3.22, q follows from his goals as well.
At this point, we are finished with the foundational level, having described
agents' beliefs and goals, events, and time. In so doing, we have characterized
agents as not striving for the unachievable, and eventually foregoing the
contingent. What is missing is commitment, to ensure that none of these goals
are given up too easily.

236

4. Persistent Goals

To capture one grade of commitment (fanatical) that an agent might have
towards his goals, we define a persistent goal, P-GOAL, to be one that the agent
will not give up until he thinks it has been satisfied, or until he thinks it will
never be true. The latter case could arise easily if the proposition p is one that
specifically mentions a time. Once the agent believes that time is past, he
believes the proposition is impossible to achieve. Specifically, we have:
Definition 4.1.

(P-GOAL x p)~f(GOAL x (LATER p)) A (BELx ~p) A
[BEFORE ((BEE x p) v (BEE x [5]-~p))
~(GOAL x (LATER p))].
Notice the use of LATER, and hence ~, above. Clearly, P-GOALs are
achievement goals; the agent's goal is that p be true in the future, and he
believes it is not currently true. As soon as the agent believes it will never be
true, we know the agent must drop his goal (by Proposition 3.26), and hence
his persistent goal. Moreover, as soon as an agent believes p is true, the belief
conjunct of P-GOAL requires that he drop the persistent goal to achieve p.
Thus, these conditions are necessary and sufficient for dropping a persistent
goal. However, the BEFORE conjunct does not say that an agent must give up
his simple goal when he thinks it is satisfied, since agents may have goals of
maintenance. Thus, achieving one's persistent goals may convert them into
maintenance goals.
4.1. The logic of P-GOAL
The logic of P-GOAL is weaker than one might expect. Unlike GOAL, P-GOAL
does not distribute over conjunction or disjunction, and is closed only under
logical equivalence. First, we examine conjunction and disjunction. Then, we
turn to implication.

4.1.1. Conjunction, disjunction, and negation
Proposition 4.2. The logic of P-GOAL:

(P-GOAL x (p v q)) ~ (P-GOAL x p) A (P-GOAL x q),
(P-GOAL x (p v q)) ~ (P-GOAL x p) v (P-GOAL xq) ,
(P-GOAL x -qp) D ~(P-GOAL x p).
First, (P-GOALx(pAq)) does not imply (P-GOALxp)A (P-GOALxq) because, although the antecedent is true, the agent might believe q is already

237

INTENTION 1S CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

true, and thus cannot have q as a P-GOAL. 15 Conversely, (P-GOALxp)A
(P-GOAL x q) does not imply (P-GOAL x (p A q)), because (GOAL x (LATER p))
A (GOALx (LATER q)) does not imply (GOALx (LATER (p A q))); p and q could
be true at different times.
Similarly, (P-GOALx (p v q)) does not imply (P-GOALx p) v (P-GOALx q)
because (GOAL x (LATER (p v q))) does not imply (GOAL x (LATER p)) v
(GOAL x (LATER q)); p could come to hold in some possible worlds compatible
with the agent's goals, and q in others. But, neither p nor q is forced to hold in
all G-accessible worlds. Moreover, the implication does not hold in the other
direction either, because of the belief conjunct of P-GOAL; although the agent
may believe ~ p or he may believe -~q, that does not guarantee he believes
-n(p v q) (i.e., -Ip ^ -~q).
With respect to the last property, note that while it is impossible to be
committed to achieving both p and ~ p (since one of them is not believed to be
false), it is quite possible to be committed to achieving (p A ~ p ) . However,
because of Proposition 3.11, (P-GOALx Op) is always false.
4.1.2. No consequential closure of P-GOAL
We demonstrate that P-GOAL is closed only under logical equivalence. Below
are listed the possible relationships between a proposition p and a consequence
q, which we term a "side-effect." Assume in all cases that (P-GOAL x p). Then,
depending on the relationship of p to q, we have the cases shown in Table 1.
We will say a "case" fails, indicated by an " N " in the third column, if
(P-GOALxq) does not hold.
Case 1 fails for a number of reasons, most importantly because the agent's
persistent goals depends on his beliefs, not on the facts. However, consider
Case 2. Even though the agent may believe p D q holds, Case 2 fails because
that implication cannot affect the agent's persistent goals, which refer to p's
being true later. That is, the agent believes p is false and does not have the goal
of it currently being true.

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

Consider Case 3, where the agent believes the implication always holds.
Although Proposition 3.26 tells us that the agent has q as a goal, we show that
the agent does not have q as a persistent goal. Recall that P-GOAL was defined
so that the only reason an agent could give up a persistent goal was if it were
believed to be satisfied or believed to be forever false. However, side-effects
are goals only because of a belief. If the belief changes, the agent need no
longer choose worlds in which p ~ q holds, and thus need no longer have q has
a goal. However, the agent would have dropped the goal for reasons other
than those stipulated by the definition of persistent goal, and so does not have
it as a persistent goal. Case 3 is, we believe, the norm.
Now, consider Case 4, in which the agent always believes the implication.
Again, q need not be a persistent goal, but for a different reason. Here, an
agent could believe the side-effect already held. Hence, by the second clause in
the definition of P-GOAL, the agent would not have a persistent goal. This
reason also blocks Case 5, closure under logical consequence. However,
instances of Case 4 and Case 5 in which the agent does not believe the
side-effect already holds would require the agent to have the side-effect as a
persistent goal. Thus, we do not get closure in these cases, but because of what
we believe to be the wrong reasons. A finer-grained semantic model than
possible worlds might block closure in a more satisfying way by allowing agents
to direct their goals towards situations that do not include side-effects. Finally,
in Case 6, where q is logically equivalent to p the agent has q as a persistent
goal. Having shown what cannot be deduced from P-GOAL, we now turn to its
major consequences.
4.2. Persistent goals constrain future beliefs and actions
An important property of agents is that they eventually give up their achievement goals (Assumption 3.25). Hence, if an agent takes on a P-GOAL, he must
give it up subject to the constraints imposed by P-GOAL.

Proposition 4.3. ~ (P-GOAL x q) ~ ~[(BEL x q) v (BEL x [ ~ q ) ]
This proposition is a direct consequence of Assumption 3.25, the definition
of P-GOAL, and Proposition 3.8. In other words, because agents eventually give
up their achievement goals, and because the agent has adopted a persistent
goal to bring about such a proposition q, eventually the agent must believe q or
believe q will never come true. A simple consequence of Proposition 4.3 is:
Proposition 4.4.

Ve(P-GOAL x (DONE x e)) 3
~[(DONE x e) v (BEE x [3-~(DONE x e ) ) ]

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

239

By Proposition 4.3, the agent eventually believes that he has done the act or
that he will never do it. By Assumption 3.20, if the agent believes he has just
done the act, then he has. We now give a crucial theorem:
Theorem 4.5. From persistence to eventualities: If someone has a persistent goal
of bringing about p, p is within his area of competence, and, before dropping his

goal, the agent will not believe p will never occur, then eventually p becomes
true:

I= (P-GOALy p) A
â¢(COMPETENT y p) A
-q(BEFORE (BEL y Dqp) -1(GOAL y (LATER p))) D
Op.
Proof. By Proposition 4.3, the agent eventually believes either that p is true, or
that p is unachievable. If he eventually thinks p is true, since he is always
competent with respect to p, he is correct. The other alternative sanctioned by
Proposition 4.3, that the agent believes p is unachievable, is ruled out by the
assumption that (it so happens to be the case that) any belief of the agent that
the goal is unachievable can come only after the agent drops his goal. Hence,
by Proposition 3.8, the goal comes about. []
If an agent who is not competent with respect to p adopts p as a persistent
goal, we cannot conclude that eventually p will be true, since the agent could
incorrectly come to believe p. If the goal is not persistent, we also cannot
conclude ~ p since the agent could give up the goal without achieving it. If the
goal actually is unachieveable, but the agent does not know this and commits
to achieving it, then we know that eventually, perhaps after trying hard to
achieve it, the agent will come to believe it is forever false and give up.
4.2.1. Acting on persistent goals
As mentioned earlier, one cannot conclude that, merely by committing to a
chosen proposition (set of possible worlds), the agent will act; someone else
could bring about the desired state of affairs. However, if the agent knows that
he is the only one who could bring it about, then, under certain circumstances,
we can conclude the agent will act. For example, propositions of the form
(DONE x a) can only be brought about by the agent x. So, if an agent always
believes the act a can be done (or at least believes it for as long as he keeps the
persistent goal), the agent will act.
A simple instance of Proposition 4.3 is one where q is (HAPPENS x a). Such a
goal is one in which the agent's goal is that eventually the next thing that
happens is his doing action a. Eventually, the agent believes either the next

240

P.R. COHEN AND H.J, LEVESQUE

action is his, or the agent eventually comes to believe he will never get the
chance. We cannot guarantee that the agent will actually do the action next, for
someone else could act before him. If the agent never believes his act will
never be done, then by Proposition 4.3, the agent will eventually believe
(HAPPENS x a). By Proposition 3.27, we know that (GOAL x (HAPPENS x a)). I f
the agent acts just when he believes the next act is his, we know that he did so
believing it would happen next and having its happening next as his goal. One
could say, loosely, that the agent acted "intentionally."
Bratman [8] argues that one applies the term "intentionally" to foreseen
consequences as well as to truly intended ones. That is, one intends a subset of
what is done intentionally. Proposition 3.27 requires only that agents have
expected effects as goals, but not as persistent goals. Hence, the agent would in
fact bring about intentionally all those foreseen consequences of his goal that
actually obtain from his doing the act. However, he would not be committed to
bringing about the side-effects, and thus did not intend to do so.
If agents adopt time-limited goals, such as (BEFORE (DONE x e) 2:30pm/6/24/
86), one cannot conclude the agent definitely will act in time, even if he
believes it is possible to act. Simply, the agent might wait too long. However,
one can conclude (see below) that the agent will not adopt another persistent
goal to do a non-NIL act he believes would make the persistent goal unachievable. Still, the agent could unknowingly (and hence, by Proposition 3.27,
accidentally) make his persistent goal forever false. If one makes the further
assumption that agents always know what they are going to do just before
doing it, then one can conclude agents will not in fact do anything to make
their persistent goals unachievable.
All these conclusions are, we believe, reasonable. However, they do not
indicate what the "normal" case is. Instead, we have characterized the
possibilities, and await a theory of default reasoning to further describe the
situation.
One final complication worth noting is that even if we assume that agents are
perfectly competent about their beliefs and goals, it is unreasonable to assume
that they are competent about their persistent goals. They may have incorrect
beliefs about the BEFORE clause and misjudge the conditions under which they
give up their achievement goals. A simple case is an agent that makes a
promise (perhaps hastily), thinks he is committed, and then, finding out more
about the situation, changes his mind and drops his goal without believing that
it is satisfiable or unachievable. Given that P-GOAL is based on whether an
agent really is committed, the question remains as to the role of beliefs in one's
commitments in a theory of this type.
5. Beliefs about Actions

We will define an agent's intending to do an action as that agent's forming a
commitment, a P-GOAL to have done that action believing one is about to do it.

assumptions to follow.
~7Actually, what counts is that an agent is about to do something that is next in the course of
events describing the world. This limitation occurs because we are not considering simultaneous
actions. Future work should loosen this restriction.
~8This assumption would not hold with the event variable replaced by an arbitrary action
expression. In the right circumstances, it is possible for an agent to think he is about to perform an
iterative action without believing he will know when the termination condition is satisfied. See the
discussion of iterative actions below.

242

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

Assumption 5.2.
Ve (AGTx e) A (SINGLE e) D
(BEE x (HAPPENS e)) v (BEE x -7(HAPPENS e)).
In other words, for each single event of which x is the agent, either he
believes the next thing to happen is his causing that event, or he believes it is
not the next thing to happen. As with Assumption 3.20, this assumption does
not hold when e is replaced by an arbitrary action expression. For example, an
agent may believe neither (HAPPENS x e;p?) nor its negation, if he has no way
of knowing whether or not 13 will be true. Moreover, the assumption needs to
be limited to singleton sequences. Otherwise, (BEL x (HAPPEN x e;(e~te2))) , for
example, would imply that one of (BEL x (HAPPEN x e;e I)) or (BELx (HAPPEN
x e;e2) ) had to be true. This would have the very undesirable effect of requiring
an agent to know (even before beginning) which branch he will take, a decision
that the agent should be able to postpone until after the execution of e. But
what we would like and what does indeed follow from Assumption 5.2 is that
agents must know the first step that will be taken:

Proposition 5.3.
~(BEL x 3e # NIL (HAPPENS x e))
3e' (SINGLE e') A (BELx (HAPPENS x e')).
The antecedent would be true if the agent believed he was about to do a
complex action (e.g., one containing a disjunction, or an iteration until a
condition is satisfied). So, there may be uncertainty in his mind about what he
is about to do. But for anything to happen at all, he must have settled on the
first step. Moreover, by Assumption 5.1, the agent also believes initially that if
there are to be other steps beyond the first one, then after that first step, he
will know the second step to take, and so on throughout the execution of the
complex action.
With these assumptions, and given the expansion of complex action expressions in terms of the primitives, we can now complete the description of the
consequences of an agent's believing he is about to do a complex action. First,
consider disjunctive actions:

Proposition 5.4. Agents are not nondeterministic:
Ve I ~ NIL, e 2 ~ NIL
(BEL x (HAPPENS x e, le2))
(BELx(HAPPENSxe,)) v (BELx(HAPPENSxe2)) v
:Iz (SINGLE z) A ( z ~ < e l ) A ( z ~ < e 2 ) A ( B E L x ( H A P P E N S x z ) ) .

I N T E N T I O N IS C H O I C E W I T H C O M M I T M E N T

243

That is, if an agent believes he is about to do a disjunction of (sequences of)
primitive events, then he must believe he is about to do one, or believe he is
about to do the other, or believe he is about to do something that is c o m m o n
to both of them. For example, if an agent believes the next action in the world
is his lifting his arm or his moving his foot, then the agent has an opinion on
which act he will do. This is a consequence of Proposition 5.3.1~
As a possible counterexample, imagine two agents, A and B having a fight.
A believes he is about to block B's punch by either lifting his right or lifting his
left arm. H o w e v e r , in our model, A does not believe that his blocking action is
the next action; the next action is B's swinging. Once B swings, whichever act
A does next will follow from A's beliefs (albeit quickly, and perhaps unconsciously). If, in fact there is no other intervening action (as with the example of
the donkey placed between two bales of hay at equal distances) then nothing
can change, so no decision will be made, and no action will take place. 2Â°
F r o m Assumption 5.1, Proposition 5.4, and the definition of conditional
actions, we can now show that an agent who is about to do a conditional action
must believe its condition to be true, or believe it to be false. More generally,
if he believes he will do a conditional action in the future, he believes he will
have an opinion at the right time on the truth of the condition. Formally, one
can show that:

Proposition 5.5. If-then-else:

re1 Ve2 Ve3
[(SINGLE e2) A (SINGLE e3) A (e 2 =Y=e3) A
(BEE x (HAPPENS x e, ;[IF p THEN e 2 ELSE e3])) [ D
(BELx (HAPPENS x e, ;[(BEL x (p/,, (HAPPENS x e2))) v
(BEL x (-rip A (HAPPENS x e3)))]?))
Essentially, the p r o o f is this: In believing that (HAPPENS x e~;[IF p THEN e 2
ELSE % 0 , x believes (HAPPENS x e~ ;(p?;e2[-Tp?;e3)). Assumption 5.1 justifies
our considering x as coming to the belief that (HAPPENSx(p?;e21-Tp?;e3)).
By Proposition 5.4, x will believe he is about to do e 2 or he will believe he is
about to do e 3. But, he believes he will only do e 2 if p holds, and e 3 otherwise.
So, he must also come to the belief that p holds and he is about to do e 2,
or -Tp holds, and he is about to do e 3.
Now, the agent will have an opinion about which part of the conditional he
will do provided that the then part and the else part do not share a c o m m o n
~gNotice also that although we have given semantics to nondeterministic actions, agents are
themselves deterministic.
2Â°This is unrealistic, of course. Ultimately, the passage of time is sufficient to change beliefs.
Perhaps one way to accommodate this in future models is to treat the passage of time as a natural
event.

244

first step (as in the above, where they are distinct events). A case where this
would not hold is that of a physical "test," such as testing that a liquid is acidic
or basic. 21 An agent who believes he is about to do:

ACID?;Dip;(RED Paper)?[-qACID?;Dip;(BLUE Paper)?
should not have to know in advance whether the liquid is acidic or basic. The
third disjunct in Proposition 5.4 allows for this possibility.
Finally, turning to iterative actions, we have the following:

Proposition 5.6. While-loops:
Vel

Ve 2

[(SINGLE e I )/x (SINGLE e2)/x (e 2 ~ e, )/x
(BEL x (HAPPENS x [WHILE p DO el];e2))] D
(BEL x ~ p ) v
(BEL x (p A (HAPPENS x e 1;(BEL x (HAPPENS x
[WHILE p DO el];e2))?)) ) .
That is, if an agent believes he is about to do a while-loop, then he either
believes that the condition is false (and does nothing) or believes it is true and
that he is about to take one step of the loop, after which, he will be in the same
state. As with the if-then-else, this holds provided the events in the while-loop
are disjoint from any subsequent action (as in the above, where the event
following the loop is distinct from the ones in the loop). A case where this
would not be true is the following: Suppose an agent decides to repeat some
action e a certain n u m b e r of times believing that at some point in the sequence,
perhaps at the very start, p will be false and remain so until the end. Even if
the agent does not know exactly when p will be false, he nonetheless believes
that he will do e at least until p is false. Thus, the agent believes he is about to
do [WHILE p DO e], even though he does not know initially whether or not p is
true. Moreover, in contrast to Assumption 5.1, he also believes that at the end
of the while-loop, p will be false but that he may not realize it at the point. On
the other hand, when the agent believes he has done a while-loop, he believes
the condition is false.
The import of these analyses of belief and action is to show that agents can
reason about complex actions (our analogue of plans) without having complete
knowledge of how the world will unfold. Rather, one can acquire the needed
information during the action's execution [36].
2~See Moore [36] for another analysis of such tests.

245

At this point, we have characterized the dependencies a m o n g an agent's
beliefs, the actions he has taken, and the actions he is about to take (that are
next). These dependencies will be vital to an understanding of intention.
6. Intention as a K i n d of Persistent Goal

With our foundation laid, we are now in a position to define this concept.
T h e r e will be two defining forms for INTEND, depending on whether the
argument is an action or a proposition.
6.1. I N T E N D 1

Typically, one intends to do actions. Accordingly, we define INTEND~ to take
an action expression as its argument.
Definition 6.1.

(INTEND~ x a)%f(P-GOAL x [DONE x (BEL x (HAPPENS a))?;a]),
where a is any action expression.
Let us examine what this says. First of all, (fanatically) intending to do an
action a is a special kind of c o m m i t m e n t (i.e., persistent goal) to have done a.
However, it is not a c o m m i t m e n t just to doing a, for that would allow the agent
to be committed to doing something accidentally or unknowingly. It seems
reasonable to require that the agent be committed to believing he is about to
do the intended action, and then doing it. Thus, intentions are future-directed,
but here directed toward something happening next. This is as close as we can
come to present-directed intention.
Secondly, it is a c o m m i t m e n t to success--to having done the action. As a
contrast, consider the following inadequate definition of INTEND1:

(INTEND~ x a) de=f'~(P-GOALx =le (HAPPENS x e;(DONE x a)?)).
This would say that an intention is a c o m m i t m e n t to being on the verge of doing
some event e, after which x would have just done a. 22 O f course, being on the
verge of doing something is not the same as doing it; any unforeseen obstacle
could permanently derail the agent from ever performing the intended act.
This would not be much of a c o m m i t m e n t .
6.1.1. Intending actions

Let us apply INTEND~ to each kind of action expression. Recall that, Proposi22Notice that e could be the last step of a.

246

P.R. C O H E N A N D H.J. L E V E S Q U E

tion 4.3, intending to do an action results in the agent's eventually forming the
belief that the action has been done (when the agent believed it was about to
happen), or eventually believing it will never happen. Our interest here is in
the former. The previous section discussed the consequences of believing one
was about to do a complex action next.
First, consider intentions to "test" p. (INTEND 1 x p?) expands into

(P-GOAL x (DONE x [BEL x (HAPPENS x p?)];p?)).
By Proposition 3.1, this is equivalent to (P-GOALx(DONEx(KNOWxp)?)),
which reduces to (P-GOALx(KNOWxp)). That is, the agent is committed to
coming to know p (and he does not know it now). However, the agent is not
committed to bringing about p himself.
Second, consider action expressions of the form e;p?. An example would be
knocking down a tree:

:le (Chopping e T) A (Tree T) A (INTEND 1 x e;(Down T)?).
That is, there is a chopping event (type) e, such that the agent is committed to
felling the tree by doing e, and he believes just prior to doing it that it will
indeed knock down the tree. Notice that e is quantified outside of the INTEND 1.
This type of intention is appropriate when there is a fixed event (or event
sequence) that an agent is willing to commit to. For example, with a small tree
and a large axe, an agent may be very confident that the chopping event will do
the trick.
However, not all trees are like this. Fortunately, chopping events can be
repeated, although it need not be obvious how many times. Thus, certain
intentions cannot be characterized in terms of a fixed sequence of events--an
agent may never come to believe of any given event sequence that it will
achieve the intention. In this case, the intention might be expressed by

3e (Chopping e T) A (Tree T) ^ (INTEND 1x [WHILE 7(Down T)DO e[).
That is, the agent intends to do e repeatedly until the tree is down. It is
important to notice that at no time does the agent need to know precisely
which chopping event will finally knock down the tree. Instead, the agent is
committed solely to executing the chopping event until the tree is down. To
give up the commitment (i.e., the persistent goal) constituting the intention,
the agent must eventually come to believe he has done the iterative action
believing it was about to happen. Also, in virtue of the definition of iterative
actions, we know that when the agent believes he has done the iterative action,
he will believe the condition is false (i.e., here, he will believe that the tree is
down).

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

247

Consider intending a conditional action. (INTEND 1 x [IF pTHEN a ELSE b])
expands into

(P-GOAL x (DONE x [BEL x (HAPPENS x [IF p THEN a ELSE b])]?;
[IF p THEN a ELSE b])).
So, we know that eventually (unless, of course, he comes to believe the
conditional is forever false), he will believe he has done the conditional in a
state in which he believed he was just about to do it. As we discussed in
Proposition 5.5 the agent cannot believe he is about to do a conditional (more
generally, a disjunction) without either believing the condition is true or
believing the condition is false. So, if one intends to do a conditional action,
one expects (with the usual caveats) not to be forever ignorant about the
condition. This seems just right.
Finally, consider intending sequences of actions. One can easily show that an
agent who intends a;b intends to do a. H o w e v e r , at the start, that agent does
not intend to do b. Rather, the agent intends to do (DONE agent a)?;b. That is,
the agent intends to do b in the context of having just done a, but does not
intend to do b by itself. H o w e v e r , once the agent believes he has just done a
while executing a;b, the agent then intends b. All along, of course, the agent
has the intention to do a;b, so that should the agent fail, he would be
committed to trying again. Thus, intentions to do complex actions result in
intentions at the right times to do the c o m p o n e n t actions.
In summary, we have defined intending to do an action in a way that
captures m a n y reasonable properties, some of which are inherited from the
c o m m i t m e n t s involved in adopting a persistent goal. However, it is often
thought that one can intend to achieve states of affairs in addition to just
actions. Some cases of this are discussed above. But INTEND~ cannot express an
agent's intending to do something himself to achieve a state of affairs, since the
event variables are quantified outside INTEND]. To allow for this case, we
define another kind of intention, INTEND 2.
6.2. INTEND 2

One might intend to b e c o m e rich, b e c o m e happy, or (perhaps controversially)
to kill one's uncle, 23 without having any idea how to achieve that state of
affairs, not even having an e n o r m o u s disjunction of possible options. In these
cases, we shall say the agent x is committed merely to doing something himself
to bring about a world state in which (RICH x) or (HAPPY x) or (DEAD u) hold.
Notice that because of the constraints that c o m e along with adopting such a
c o m m i t m e n t , this is stronger than having only a desire or a simple goal.
23We are

not trying to be morbid here; just setting up a classic example.

248

P.R. C O H E N A N D H.J. L E V E S Q U E

Definition 6.2.
(INTEND 2 x p),Jef
(P-GOAL x :le (DONE x [(BEL x :le' (HAPPENS x e';p?)) A
-q(GOAL x -q (HAPPENS x e;p?))]?;e;p?)) .
We shall explain this definition in a n u m b e r of steps. First, notice that to
INTEND 2 to bring about p, an agent is committed to doing some sequence of
events e himself, after which p holds. However, as earlier, to avoid allowing an
agent to intend to make p true by committing himself to doing something
accidentally or unknowingly, we require the agent to think he is about to do
something (event sequence e ' ) bringing about p.24 From Proposition 5.3 we
know that even though the agent believes only that he will do some sequence
of events achieving p, the agent will know which initial step he is about to take.
Now, it seems to us that the only way, short of truly wishful thinking, that an
agent can believe he is about to do something to bring about p is if the agent in
fact has a plan (good, bad, or ugly) for bringing it about. In general, it is quite
difficult to define what a plan is, or define what it means for an agent to have a
plan. 25 The best we can do, and that is not too far off, is to say that agent must
believe he is about to do something (called e' here) that will bring about p.
What is left for us to specify is under what conditions this belief is justified,
ensuring for instance, that the agent never has such a belief when he has
absolutely no idea of how to proceed. 26
Finally, we require that prior to doing e to bring about p, the agent not have
as a goal e's not bringing about p. In other words, while there may be
uncertainty in the agent's mind as to which action will ultimately bring about p
(for example, he may have a conditional plan), what does in fact happen had
better be compatible with the agent's goals. This condition is required to
handle the following example, due to Chisholm [ll] and discussed in Searle's
book [47]. An agent intends to kill his uncle. On the way to his uncle's house,
this intention causes him to become so agitated that he loses control of his car,
and runs over a pedestrian, who happens to be his uncle. Although the uncle is
dead, we would surely say that the action that the agent did was not what was
intended.
Let us cast this problem in terms of INTEND2, but without the condition
stating that the agent should not want e not to bring about p. Call this
24The definition does not use e instead of e' because that would quantify e into the agent's
beliefs, requiring that he (eventually) have picked out a precise sequence of events that he thinks
will bring about p. If we wanted to do that, we could use INTENDs.
25See [41] for a discussion of these issues.
~6One possibility is to make sure this belief only arises by existential generalization from a belief
involving a particular action description (that is, the plan) achieving p. However, one cannot
express this constraint in our logic since one cannot quantify over action expressions.

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

249

INTEND:,. So, assume the following is true: (INTEND 2, x (DEAD u)). The agent
thus has a commitment to doing some sequence of events resulting in his
uncle's death, and immediately prior to doing it, he has to believe there would
be some sequence (e') that he was about to do that would result in the uncle's
death. However, the example satisfies these conditions, but the event he in fact
does that kills his uncle may not be the one foreseen to do so. A jury requiring
only INTEND2, to convict for first-degree murder would find the agent to be
guilty. Yet, we clearly have the intuition that the death was accidental.
Searle argues that a prior intention should cause an "intention in action"
that presents the killing of the uncle as an "intentional object," and this
causation is self-referential. To explain Searle's analysis would take us too far
afield. However, we can handle this case by adding the second condition to the
agent's mental state that just prior to doing the action that achieves p, the
agent not only believes he is about to do some sequence of events to bring
about p, he also does not want what he in fact does, e, not to bring about p. In
the case in question (intuitively), the agent's plan is to get to his uncle's house
and take it from there. Driving onto the sidewalk (and killing someone) is not
one of the possible outcomes of this plan and so is ruled out by the agent's
beliefs and goals. So, in swerving off the road, the agent may still have
believed he was about to do something e' that would kill his uncle (and, by
Proposition 3.26, he wanted e' to kill his uncle), but even allowing for
indeterminacy in his plan, in none of his chosen worlds is his swerving off the
road what kills his uncle.
Hence, our analysis predicts that the agent did not do what he intended,
even though the end state was achieved, and resulted from his adopting an
intention. Let us now see how this analysis stacks up against the problems and
related desiderata.
7. Meeting the Desiderata for Intention
In this section we show how various properties of the commonsense concept of
intention are captured by our analysis based on P-GOAL. In what follows, we
shall use INTEND 1 or INTEND2 as best fits the example. Similar results hold for
analogous problems posed with the other form of intention.
7.1. Bratman's functional roles played by intention
We reiterate Bratman's [7, 9] analysis of the roles that intentions typically play
in the mental life of agents:
Intentions normally pose problems for the agent; the agent needs to determine a
way to achieve them

If the agent intends an action as described by an action expression, then the
agent knows in general terms what to do. But, the action expression may have

250

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

disjunctions and conditionals in it. Hence, the agent would not know at the
time of forming the intention just what will be done. However, we have shown
in Section 6.1.1 that eventually, the agent will know which actions should be
taken next. In the case of nonspecific intentions, such as (INTEND 2 x p), we can
derive via Proposition 4.3 that, under the normal circumstances where the
agent does not learn that p is unachievable, the agent eventually believes there
is some sequence of events that he has done prior to which he believed he was
about to achieve p. Hence, our analysis shows the problem that is posed by
adopting a non-specific intention, but does not encode the solution--that the
agent will form a plan specifying just what that sequence of events would be.

Intentions provide a "screen of admissibility" for adopting other intentions
If an agent has an intention to do b, and the agent (always) believes that doing
a prevents the achievement of b, then the agent cannot have the intention to do
a;b, or even the intention to do a before doing b. Thus, the following holds:
Theorem 7.1. Screen of admissibility:

Vx (INTEND, x b) A Iq(BEL x[(DONE x a) ~ E3~(DONE x b)])
~(INTEND, xa;b) ,
where a and b are arbitrary action expressions, and their free variables have been
bound outside.
The proof is simply that there are no possible worlds in which the two
intentions and the belief could all hold; in the agent's chosen worlds, if a has
just been done, b will never be done. Hence, the agent cannot intend to do a
before doing 13. Similarly, if the agent first intends to do a, and believes the
above relationship between a and b, then the agent cannot also adopt the
intention to do b. 27
Notice that our agents cannot knowingly (and hence, by Proposition 3.27,
deliberately) act against their own best interests. That is, they cannot intentionally act in order to m a k e their persistent goals unachieveable. Moreover, if
they have adopted a time-limited intention, they cannot intend to do some
other act knowing it would make achieving that time-limited intention forever
false.

Agents" "track" the success of their attempts to achieve intentions
In other words, agents keep their intentions after failure. Assume an agent has
an intention to do a, and then does something, e, thinking it would bring about
27Notice that the theorem does not require quantification over primitive acts, but allows a and b
to be arbitrary action expressions.

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

251

the doing of a, but he then comes to believe it did not. If the agent does not
think that a can never be done, does the agent still have the intention to do a?
Yes.
Theorem 7.2.

I= (DONE x [(INTEND I x a) A (BEL x (HAPPENS x a))]?;e)/x
(BEL x q(DONE x a))/x -q(BEL x rq~(DONE x a)) D
(INTEND 2 x a) .
The p r o o f of this follows immediately from the definition of INTENDs, which
is based on P-GOAL which states that the intention cannot be given up until it is
believed to have been achieved or to be unachievable. H e r e , the agent believes
it has not been achieved and does not believe it to be unachieveable. Hence,
the agent keeps the intention.
O t h e r writers have proposed that if an agent intends to do a, then:

The agent believes it is possible to do action a
We do not have a modal o p e r a t o r for possibility. But we can state, via
Proposition 3.26, that the agent does not believe a will never be done. This is
not precisely the same as the desired property, but surely is close enough for
current purposes.

Sometimes, the agent believes he will in fact do a
This is a consequence of T h e o r e m 4.5, which states the conditions (call them
C) under which Q(DONE x a) holds, given the intention to do a. So, if the agent
believes he has the intention, and believes C holds, ~(DONE x a) follows from
his beliefs as well.

The agent does not believe he will never do a
This principle is e m b o d i e d directly in Proposition 3.26, which is validated by
the simple model theoretical constraint that worlds that are consistent with
one's choices are included in worlds that are consistent with one's beliefs
(worlds one thinks one might be in).

Agents need not intend all the expected side-effects o f their intentions
Recall that in an earlier problem, an agent intended to have his teeth filled.
Not knowing about anaesthetics (one could assume this took place just as they
were being first used in dentistry), he believed that it was always the case that
if one's teeth are filled, one will feel pain. One could even say that surely the
agent chose to undergo pain. Nonetheless, one would not like to say that he
intended to undergo pain.

252

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

This problem is easily handled in our scheme: Let x be the patient. Assume p
is (Filled-teeth x), and q is (In-pain x). Now, we know that the agent has surely
chosen pain (by Proposition 3.28). Given all this, the following holds (see
Section 4.1.2, Case 3):
(INTEND 2 x p)/x (BEL x C](p D q)) D (INTEND 2 x q).
Thus, agents need not intend the expected side-effects of their intentions.
At this point, the formalism captures each of Bratman's principles. Let us
now see how it avoids the "Little Nell" problem.

7.2. Solving the "Little Nell" problem: When not to give up goals
Recall that in the "Little Nell" problem, Dudley never saves Nell because he
believes he will be successful. Persistent goals avoid this problem; if Dudley
adopts a persistent goal, he will drop it when he believes he has saved her, not
when he believes he will save her. Thus, we have advocated the following
initially plausible principles:
(1) Give up the intention that p when you believe p holds.
(2) Under at least some circumstances, an agent's intending that p entails
the agent's believing that p will eventually be true.
These principles sound reasonable. One would think that a robot who forms
the intention to bring someone a bottle of beer should drop that intention as
soon as he brings the person the beer. Not dropping it constrains the adoption
of other intentions, and may lead to person's receiving a year's supply of beer.
The second principle says that at least in some (perhaps the normal) circumstances, one believes one's intentions will be fulfilled. Both of these principles
can be found in our analysis.
One might think these principles entail a problem when one adopts a
temporal or dynamic logic (modal or not, branching or not) that expresses "p
will be true" as (FUTURE p) or ~p. Apply principle (2) to a proposition p of
the form ~q. For example, let p represent "Nell is out of danger" by Â©(Saved
Nell). 2~ Hence, if the agent has the intention to bring about ~(Saved Nell),
under the right circumstances ("all other things being equal"), the agent
believes ~ ( S a v e d Nell). But, in most temporal logics, < ~ ( S a v e d Nell) entails
~(Saved Nell). So, it is likely that the agent believes that ~(Saved Nell) holds as
well. Now, apply principle (1). Here, the agent had the intention to achieve
~($aved Nell) and the agent believes it is already true! So, the agent drops the
intention, and Nell gets mashed.
28Notice that this goal is a bit out of the ordinary. The only way we can make sense of it is to
allow Dudley to want to scare Nell a bit by, for example, letting her hear the approaching train, so
that she will be much more grateful to her savior.

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

253

Our theory of intention based on P-GOAL avoids this problem because an
agent's having a P-GOAL requires that the goal be true later and that the agent
not believe it is currently true. The cases of interest are those in which the
agent purportedly adopts the intention and believes he will succeed. Thus,
(BELx~q),
and so (BELx ~q). However, while it is certainly possible to
intend to achieve q, an agent never forms the intention to achieve anything like
Â©q since, as already noted, (P-GOALx ~ q ) is always false.
One might argue that this analysis prevents agents from dropping their
intentions when they think another agent will achieve the end goal. For
example, one might want it to be possible for Dudley to drop the intention to
save Nell (himself) because he thinks someone else, e.g., McDermott's Dick
Daring, is going to save her. There are two cases to consider. The first case
involves goals that can only be achieved once. The second case concerns goals
that can be reachieved. We treat the second case in the next section. Regarding
the first, one can easily show the following:
Theorem 7.3. Dropping futile intentions:

Vx (y Â¢ x) A (BEL x ~ 3 e (DONE y Tp?;e;p?)) D
~(INTEND 2 x p) v
7(gEL x [:::le (DONE y -lp?;e;p?) D [~73e (DONE x -lp?;e;p?)]).
That is, if an agent believes anyone else is truly going to achieve p, then
either the agent does not intend to achieve p himself, or he does not believe p
can be achieved only once. Contrapositively, if an agent intends to achieve p,
and always believes p can only be achieved once, the agent cannot simultaneously believe someone else is definitely going to achieve p. Intuitively, the
reason is simple. If the agent believes someone else is definitely, going to
achieve p, then, because the agent believes that after doing so no one else
could do so, the agent cannot have the persistent goal of achieving p himself;
he cannot consistently believe he will achieve p first, nor can he achieve p later.
A more rigorous proof is left to the determined reader.
Finally, our approach even allows Dudley to race Dick to save Nell. This is
possible because in a true race, Dudley would not believe Dick will definitely
win, and vice versa for Dick. Hence, Dudley would not be required to drop his
intention. If Dudley did think Dick would definitely win, he might still run the
race, but in pursuit of a different intention, for example, to finish the race, or
convince Nell that he was trying, etc.
We have the intuition that Dudley should not drop his plan believing it will
be successful because the only justification he has for that belief is his intending
to do the planned actions. On the other hand, we should allow Dudley to drop
his plan to save Nell when there is an alternate justification. McDermott [35]

254

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

advocates a data-dependency approach for recording such justifications. We
cannot do likewise, but so far do not need to.
At this point, we have met the desiderata. Thus, the analysis so far has
merit; but we are not finished. The definition of P-GOAL can be extended to
make explicit what is only implicit in the commonsense concept of intention-the background of other justifying beliefs and intentions. Doing so will make
our agents more reasonable.
8. An End to Fanaticism
As the formalism stands now, once an agent has adopted a persistent goal, he
will not be deterred. For example, if agent A receives a request from agent B,
and decides to cooperate by adopting a persistent goal to do the requested act,
B cannot "turn A off." This is clearly a defect that needs to be remedied. The
remedy depends on our expanding the conditions under which one can drop a
persistent goal.
8.1. Relativized persistent goal
Definition 8.1. Persistent, relativized goal:

(P-R-GOAL x p q) ~'(GOAL x (LATER p)) A (BEL x qp)/,,
(BEFORE [(BEL x p) v (BEL x C]qp) v (BEL xqq)]
-q(GOAL x (LATER p))).
That is, a necessary condition for giving up a P-R-GOAL is that the agent x
believes it is satisfied, or believes it is unachievable, or believes -qq. Such
propositions q form a background that justifies the agent's intentions. In many
cases, such propositions constitute the agent's reasons for adopting the intention. For example, x could adopt the persistent goal to buy an umbrella relative
to his belief that it will rain. He could then consider dropping his persistent
goal should he come to believe that the forecast has changed.
Our analysis supports the observation that intentions can (loosely speaking)
be viewed as the contents of plans (e.g., [9, 15, 40]). Although we have not
given a formal analysis of plans here (see [40] for such an analysis), the
commitments one undertakes with respect to an action in a plan depend on the
other planned actions, as well as the pre- and post-conditions brought about by
those actions. If x adopts a persistent goal 13 relative to (GOALxq), then
necessary conditions for x's dropping his goal include his believing that he no
longer has q as a goal. Thus, (P-R-GOAL x 13(GOAL x q)) characterizes an agent's
having a persistent subgoal p relative to the supergoal q. An agent's dropping a
supergoal is now a sufficient (but not necessary) prerequisite for his dropping a

INTENTION IS CHOICE WITH COMMITMENT

255

subgoal. 29 Thus, with the change to relativized persistent goals, we open up the
possibility of having a complex web of interdependencies among the agent's
goals, intentions, and beliefs. We always had the possibility of conditional
P-GOALs. Now, we have added background conditions that could lead to a
revision of one's persistent goals. The definitions of intention given earlier can
now be recast in terms of P-R-GOAL.
Definition 8.2.

(INTEND I x a q ) ~f
(P-R-GOAL x
[(DONE x (BEL x (HAPPENS x a;p?))?;a;p?)]

q).
Definition 8.3.

(INTEND 2 x p q)~f
(P-R-GOAL x
3e (DONE x [(BEL x 3e' (HAPPENS x e';p?)) A
-q (GOAL x 7(HAPPENS x e;p?))]?;e;p?)

q).
With these changes, the dependencies of an agent's intentions on his beliefs,
other goals, intentions and so on, become explicit. For example, we can
express an agent's intending to take an umbrella relative to believing it will rain
on March 5, 1986 as:

=le,u (Take u e) A [INTEND~ x e;3/5/86? O(Raining A 3/5/86)].
One can now describe agents whose primary concern is with the end result of
their intentions, not so much with achieving those results themselves. An agent
may first adopt a persistent goal to achieve p, and then (perhaps because he
does not know any other agent who will, or can, do so), subsequently decides
to achieve p himself, relative to that persistent goal. So, the following is true of
the agent:

(P-GOAL x p)/x (INTEND~ x p (P-GOAL x p)).
If someone else achieves p (and the agent comes to believe is true), the agent
29Also, notice that (P-GOALx p) is now subsumed by (P-R-GOAL x p-lp).

256

P.R. COHEN AND H.J. LEVESQUE

must drop (P-GOALxp), and is therefore free to drop the c o m m i t m e n t to
achieving p himself. Notice, however, that for goals that can be reachieved, the
agent is not forced to drop the intention, as the agent may truly be committed
to achieving p himself.
Matters get more interesting still when we allow the relativization conditions
q to include propositions about other agents. For example, if q is (GOAL y s),
then y's goal is an interpersonal supergoal for x. The kind of intention that is
engendered by a request seems to be a P-R-GOAL. Namely, the speaker tries to
bring it about that

(P-R-GOAL addressee
(DONE addressee a)
[GOAL speaker Â©(DONE addressee a)]) .
The addressee can get "off the h o o k " if he learns the speaker does not want
him to do the act after all.
Notice also that given this partial analysis of requesting, a hearer who merely
says " O K " and thereby accedes to a request has (made it mutually believed
that he has) adopted a c o m m i t m e n t relative to the speaker's desires. In other
words, he is committed to the speaker to do the requested action. This helps to
explain how social commitments can arise out of communication. However,
this is not the place to analyze speech acts (but see [14]).
Finally, interlocking commitments are obtained when two agents are in the

following states: (P-R-GOAL x p (GOAL y p)), and (P-R-GOAL y p (GOAL x p)).
Each agent will keep his intention at least as long as the other keeps it. For
example, each might have the intention to lift a table. But each would not
bother to try unless the other also had the same intention. This goes partway
towards realizing a notion of "joint agency" espoused by Searle [48]. 30
In summary, persistent relativized goals provide a useful analysis of intention, and extend the commonsense concept by making explicit the conditions
under which an agent will revise his intentions. It should be emphasized that a
description of intention and its role in maintaining rational balance is not the
same as a theory of intention formation. We are now in a position to study the
latter.
8.2. Social commitments

Recently, a n u m b e r of authors have emphasized the role that social commitments play in fostering and regulating social interaction. Fikes [17] points out
3oUltimately, one can envision circular interlinkages in which one agent adopts a persistent goa|
provided another agent has adopted it relative to the first agent having adopted it relative to the

c o m m i t m e n t s to one another. For example, in committing to perform a service
for someone, goal achievement (performing the service) is secondary to being
released from the c o m m i t m e n t . One way to be released is to convince the
consumer of the service that the goal is achieved, is not achieveable, or is
unnecessary. These are precisely the conditions for dropping a P-R-GOAL.
Winograd and Flores [49] claim that social c o m m i t m e n t s constitute the foundation of communication and social interaction, and, by extension, office work.
We agree with both of these claims. However, neither of these works provides
an analysis of social commitment. This p a p e r offers an analysis of what is, to us
at least, a logically prior c o n c e p t - - a n agent's having an internal commitment. It
makes little sense to speak of social c o m m i t m e n t if agents could not be
internally committed. 3~ We provide a f r a m e w o r k for specifying conditions
regulating when an agent can drop an internal c o m m i t m e n t , conditions that
m a p reasonably well onto FiLes' and Winograd and Flores' observations.

9. Implications for System Architecture
The theory presented here can be regarded as a specification for the design of
an artificial agent, and should not be viewed as a logic with which an agent
should reason. H o w , then, does this specification relate to system architecture?
First, the theory states that agents sho,tld have a distinguished mental state,
call it GOAL, that is related in the ways we discussed to the mental state
encoding the system's knowledge or beliefs (which we have termed BEL). As
Rosenschein and Kaelbling [46] have shown, systems can be designed to satisfy
knowledge (and belief) axioms without themselves manipulating knowledge (or
belief) formulas. 3e Moreover, the mental states encoding the agent's beliefs and
goals need to bear the appropriate relations to the agent's own primitive
actions. We have described these relationships in some detail, but we have not
been able to specify the causally self-referential connection between these
mental states and the production of action. However, that should not be too
surprising given the long-standing philosophical issues involved (e.g., see
[26, 47]). The present theory merely constrains that causal connection. Apparently, it is easier to build systems that e m b o d y that causal connection than it is
to describe it formally.
The second design principle to be gained from the present work is that
agents should be committed. That is, their being in the state GOAL with respect
3t We do not view young children as being socially committed until they have reached an
"appropriate" state of maturity. One suggestion of our work is that that "appropriate" stage
includes what we are terming "rational balance."
32The extension of their "situated automata" method of encoding knowledge to deal with
incomplete knowledge of the mental states of other agents, is still an open problem.

to some propositional content should persist at least until the conditions
specified herein for P-R-GOAl_ obtain. Of particular interest are the "relevance"
conditions under which one would drop a relativized persistent goal. One could
design a system that maintains rational balance by keeping its goals in a
dependency network along with its beliefs, as has been done for the robot
Flakey at SRI under the Intelligent Communicating Agents project. The robot
would be in a goal state at least until the supporting mental states change. The
relationship between specification and architecture is thus made apparent by
encoding that dependency network in the last argument position of P-R-GOAL.
Such agents will be committed in virtue of their architecture. But, although
individual agents need not be built to reason explicitly about their o w n
intentions and commitments, they will need to reason about the intentions and
commitments of other agents in order to engage in communication. Thus, our
developing a method by which agents reason about the intentions and commitments of others is still an important goal.
10. Conclusion

This paper establishes basic principles governing the rational balance among an
agent's beliefs, actions, and intentions. Such principles provide specifications
for artificial agents, and approximate a theory of human action (as philosophers
use the term). By making explicit the conditions under which an agent can drop
his goals, that is, by specifying how the agent is c o m m i t t e d to his goals, the
formalism captures a number of important properties of intention. Specifically,
the formalism provides analyses for Bratman's three characteristic functional
roles played by intentions [8, 9], and shows how agents can avoid intending all
the foreseen side-effects of what they actually intend. Finally, the analysis
shows how intentions can be adopted relative to a background of relevant
beliefs and other intentions or goals. By relativizing one agent's intentions in
terms of beliefs about another agent's intentions (or beliefs), we derive a
preliminary account of interpersonal commitments.
The utility of the theory for describing people or artificial agents will depend
on the fidelity of the assumptions. It does not seem unreasonable to require
that a robot not procrastinate forever. Moreover, we surely would want a robot
to be persistent in pursuing its goals, but not fanatically so. Furthermore, we
would want a robot to drop goals given to it by other agents when it determines
the goals need not be achieved. So, as a coarse description of an artificial
agent, the theory seems workable.
The theory is not only useful for describing single agents in dynamic
multiagent worlds, it is also useful for describing their interactions, especially
via the use of communicative acts. In a companion paper [14], we present a
theory of speech acts that builds on the foundations laid here.
Much work remains. The action theory only allowed for possible worlds

consisting of single courses of events. Moreover, there were no truly alternative worlds, as would be necessary for a branching-time logic. Further developments should include basing the analysis on partial worlds/situations [6], and
on temporal logics that allow for simultaneous actions [2, 20, 32]. Undoubtedly, the theory would be strengthened by the use of default and nonmonotonic
reasoning.
Lastly, we can now allay the reader's fears about the mental state of the
rationally unbalanced robot, Willie. If manufactured according to our principles, it is guaranteed that the problems described will not arise again; Willie
will act on its intentions, not in spite of them, and will give them up when you
say so. Of course, Willie is not yet very smart (as we did not say how agents
should form plans), but he is determined.
